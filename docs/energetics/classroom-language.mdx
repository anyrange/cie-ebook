### Checking previous knowledge:

- The topic of the lesson is Hessâ€™s Law. Can anyone draw an enthalpy cycle?
- Can you remember what we did in the last class?
- Does anyone already know what this is called?
- Can anyone tell me how to say XXX in English?

### Encouraging your students to speak:

- Could you speak up a bit, please?
- Would you like to try to answer, Amir?
- Can anyone help Amir with the answer?
- Go on ...
- I am sure you can answer that.
- Can you explain that to the rest of the class?
