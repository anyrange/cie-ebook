## HOW do you group students in the classroom?

**Learning Stations**  
A teacher can even redesign a flexible seating classroom to better accommodate learning stations because they are such an important part of teaching. Stations can be easily set up in a specific area. You could simply create numbered “learning zones” or stations around the room by hanging up paper signs.  
With any kind of student-centered lesson, there must be accountability for it to work. It can come in the form of informal observations as students are working and individual responses to grade after stations.  
For all other station responses, a simple paper recording sheet, but there are other options if you are 1:1 with technology:

- a Google doc, with sections for each station;
- a Google form with a page for each station, or multiple forms, one for each station;
- a Google Classroom “question” for each station; and
- a Padlet board for each station.

The Google Classroom, for example, organizes all responses in one visible spot, which also makes for easier grading. The students can see each others’ responses once they submit, so it’s great seeing the small-group discussions build upon one another throughout the course of a stations lesson. It also creates a great resource that students can return to and reflect on after learning.  
Remember, with stations, a teacher is the guide on the side, instead of the sage on the stage! Even though you’re not necessarily “in control” of the whole class, delivering a lecture, you’re still the expert in the room. Sure, stations are student-centered, but what you do during stations can take the lesson from good to great. If you merely sit at your desk the whole time, your students will a) see that you do not value the content or care enough to get involved, b) have no reason to stay on task because there’s little accountability. But if you are circulating throughout the room, students will quickly recognize how much you care and value the lesson.  
You can also set-up vocabulary stations. You can easily add or substitute your own activities to mix things up:

- **Station 1:** Vocabulary Charades
- **Station 2:** Vocabulary Pictionary
- **Station 3:** Writing Task
- **Station 4:** Quizlet/Your Choice
