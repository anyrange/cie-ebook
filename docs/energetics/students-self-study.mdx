## Assignments:

    <strong>
      1. Using example, develop tasks for one of the following videos: your
      video worksheet should have THREE PHASES:
    </strong>
    <em> pre-watching, while-watching</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>
      post-watching
    </em> <strong>exercises.</strong>

## Learning objectives:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.3.1.1 understand and be able to define enthalpy and enthalpy change
      (ΔH)
    </td>
    <td>
      11.3.1.3 understand that chemical reactions involve the making and
      breaking of bonds and the concept of bond enthalpy
    </td>
    <td>
      11.3.1.5 be able to use mean bond enthalpies to estimate ΔH for reactions
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.3.1.2 understand the need for standard enthalpies and be able to define
      standard enthalpy
    </td>
    <td>11.3.1.4 be able to determine bond enthalpies from data</td>
    <td>
      11.3.1.6 be able to determine simple enthalpy changes experimentally and
      calculate enthalpy change from experimental data
      <br />
      11.3.1.7 understand the underlying principle of Hess’ Law and be able to
      use it calculate enthalpy changes in reactions
    </td>

#### 2. Develop one of the fragments of Lesson plan: you should use

- a lesson plan template [(**Appendix 1**)](../appendix/1);
- one of the CLIL techniques [(**Appendix 2**)](../appendix/2);
- teaching methods; and
- learning objectives above.
