### 1. The molecular mass of a substance

:::note Notes:
The molecular mass of a substance is the sum of the average masses of the atoms in one molecule of a substance. It is calculated by adding together the atomic masses of the elements in the substance, each multiplied by its subscript (written or implied) in the molecular formula. Because the units of atomic mass are atomic mass units, the units of molecular mass are also atomic mass units. The procedure for calculating molecular masses is illustrated in Example 1.
:::

#### Example

Calculate the molecular mass of propanol, whose condensed structural formula is  
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH  
**Given:** molecule  
**Asked for:** molecular mass

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Determine the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.  
**B.** Obtain the atomic masses of each element from the periodic table and multiply the atomic mass of each element by the number of atoms of that element.  
**C.** Add together the masses to give the molecular mass.

**Solution:**  
**A.** The molecular formula of propanol may be written in three different ways: CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub>OH (which illustrates the presence of a propyl group, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>−, and an −OH group), C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>OH, and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O; all show that propanol has three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom.  
**B.** Taking the atomic masses from the periodic table, we obtain:  
3×atomic; mass of carbon=3 atoms · (12.011amu/atom) =36.033amu  
8×atomic; mass of hydrogen=8 atoms · (1.0079amu/atom) =8.0632amu  
1×atomic; mass of oxygen=1atoms · (15.9994amu/atom) =15.9994amu  
**C.** Adding together the masses gives the molecular mass:  
36.033amu + 8.0632amu + 15.9994amu = 60.0956amu  
**Alternatively,** we could have used unit conversions to reach the result in one step:Mr(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O) = [3 atoms · (12.011amu/1atom C)] + [8 atoms H · (1.0079amu/1atom H)] + [1atoms O · (15.9994amu/1atom O)]

**Answer:**  
the molecular mass of propanol is 60.0956amu or Mr(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O) =60.0956amu

### 2. Molar Mass

:::note Notes:
The molar mass is defined as the mass in grams of 1 mol of that substance. One mole of isotopically pure carbon-12 has a mass of 12 g. For an element, the molar mass is the mass of 1 mol of atoms of that element; for a covalent molecular compound, it is the mass of 1 mol of molecules of that compound; for an ionic compound, it is the mass of 1 mol of formula units. That is, the molar mass of a substance is the mass (in grams per mole) of 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> atoms, molecules, or formula units of that substance. In each case, the number of grams in 1 mol is the same as the number of atomic mass units that describe the atomic mass, the molecular mass, or the formula mass, respectively. The molar mass of any substance is its atomic mass, molecular mass, or formula mass in grams per mole. The periodic table lists the atomic mass of carbon as 12.011 amu; the average molar mass of carbon—the mass of 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> carbon atoms—is therefore 12.011 g/mol

#### Example 1.

Calculate the number of moles and molecules of oxygen in 4g oxygen molecules with the formula O<sub>2</sub>  
**Given:** mass and molecular formula  
**Asked for:** number of moles and number of molecules

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use the molecular formula of the compound to calculate its molecular mass in grams per mole.  
**B.** Convert from mass to moles by dividing the mass given by the compound’s molar mass.  
**C.** Convert from moles to molecules by multiplying the number of moles by Avogadro’s number.

**Solution:**  
**A.** The molecular mass of oxygen can be calculated from its molecular formula using the method:  
Mr(O<sub>2</sub>) = (2 atoms of O) · (15.9994amu/atom O) = 31.9988amu  
The molar mass of oxygen is 31.9988 g/mol  
**B.** The number of moles of oxygen present in 4g can be calculated by dividing the mass (in grams) by the molar mass (in grams per mole):

<center>
  <Math code="n=\frac{m}{M}" />
</center>
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="n(O2)=\frac{4g}{31.9988\ gmol^-1}= 0.125\ mol" />
</center>{' '}

**C.** To calculate the number of molecules in the sample, we multiply the number of moles by Avogadro’s number:

<center>
  N (number of molecules) = N<sub>a</sub>· n
</center>
<center>
  N(O<sub>2</sub>) = 6,02 · 1023 mol<sup>-1</sup> · 0.125 mol = 0.7525 · 10
  <sup>23</sup> molecules
</center>{' '}

**Answer:**  
n(O<sub>2</sub>) = 0.125 mol; N(O<sub>2</sub>) = 0.7525 × 10<sup>23</sup> molecules

#### Example 2.

Calculate the mass of 1.75 mol of each compound:

1. SO<sub>2</sub> (sulfur dioxide)
2. Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (sodium carbonate)  
   **Given:** number of moles and molecular or empirical formula  
   **Asked for:** mass

**Strategy:**
**A.** Calculate the molecular mass of the compound in grams from its molecular formula (if covalent) or empirical formula (if ionic).  
**B.** Convert from moles to mass by multiplying the moles of the compound given by its molar mass.

**Solution:**  
We begin by calculating the molecular mass of SO2 and the formula mass of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.  
**A.** The molar mass of SO2 is obtained from its molecular mass as follows:  
Mr(SO<sub>2</sub>) = (1 atom of S) · (32.065amu/atom S) + (2 atoms of O) · (15.9994amu/atom O) =32.065amu + 31.9988amu = 64.0638amu  
The molar mass of SO<sub>2</sub> is 64.0638 g/mol.  
The mass of 1.75 mol of SO2 is calculated as follows:  
m(SO<sub>2</sub>) = n · M  
m(SO<sub>2</sub>) = 1.75 · 64.0638 gmol<sup>-1</sup> = 112.1165g  
**B.** The formula mass of Na2CO3 is obtained as follows:  
The formula mass [Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>] = [(2 atoms of Na) · (22.98977amu/atom Na) + (1 atom of C) · (12.011amu/atom C)+ (3 atoms of O) · (15.9994amu/atom C)] = 45.97954amu +12.011amu +47.9982amu =105.98874amu  
The molar mass of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is 105.98874 g/mol.  
The mass of 1.75 mol of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is calculated as follows:  
m(Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) = n · M  
m(Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) = 1.75 · 105.98874gmol<sup>-1</sup> = 185.48029g

**Answer:**
m(SO<sub>2</sub>) = 112.1165g; m(Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) = 185.48029g

### 4. Calculating Mass Percentages

:::note Notes:
Mass percentage is calculated as the mass of a component divided by the total mass of the mixture, multiplied by 100%<br/>

<center>
  <Math code="\%\ by\ mass =\frac{mass(component)}{mass(mixture)}·100\%" />
</center>
<br />
The percent composition AxBy of a compound can also be determined from the
formula of the compound. The subscripts in the formula are first used to
calculate the mass of each element in one mole of the compound. That is divided
by the molar mass of the compound and multiplied by 100%
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="\%\ by\ mass\ (A) =\frac{m(A\ in\ 1\ mol\ of\ the\ compound)}{molar\ mass(A_xB_y)}·100\%" />
</center>
<br />
:::

#### Example

Glycine is the simplest amino acid that reduces psycho-emotional stress and increases mental productivity. Its molecular formula is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. Calculate the mass percentage of each element in glycine. Calculate the mass of carbon in a 1.00 g packet of Equal, assuming it is pure glycine.  
**Given:** molecular formula and mass of sample  
**Asked for:** mass percentage of all elements and mass of one element in sample

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use atomic masses from the periodic table to calculate the molar mass of glycine.  
**B.** Divide the mass of each element by the molar mass of glycine then multiply by 100 to obtain percentages.  
**C.** To find the mass of an element contained in a given mass of glycine, multiply the mass of glycine by the mass percentage of that element, expressed as a decimal.

**Solution:**  
**A.** We calculate the mass of each element in 1 mol of glycine and the molar mass of glycine, here to three decimal places:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>2 C</td>
    <td>(2 mol C)(12.011 g/mol C) =</td>
    <td>24.022 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5 H</td>
    <td>(5 mol H)(1.008 g/mol H) =</td>
    <td>5.04 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1N</td>
    <td>(1 mol N)(14.007 g/mol N) =</td>
    <td>14.007 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2O</td>
    <td>(2 mol O)(15.999 g/mol O) =</td>
    <td>31.998 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>
    </td>
    <td>molar mass of aspartame</td>
    <td>75.067 g/mol</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**B.** To calculate the mass percentage of each element, we divide the mass of each element in the compound by the molar mass of glycine and then multiply by 100 to obtain percentages, here reported to two decimal places:

<Math code="m\ \%\ C\ =\frac{24.022\ g\ C}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 32\%\ C" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="m\ \%\ H\ =\frac{5.04\ g\ H}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 6.714\%\ H" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="m\ \%\ N\ =\frac{14.007\ g\ N}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 18.659\%\ N" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="m\ \%\ O\ =\frac{31.998 \ g\ O}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 42.627\%\ O" />
<br />
As a check, we can add the percentages together: 32% + 6.714% + 18.659% + 42.627%
= 100.00% If you obtain a total that differs from 100% by more than about ±1%, there
must be an error somewhere in the calculation.{' '}

**C.** The mass of carbon in 1.00 g of glycine is calculated as follows:

<Math code="m\ of\ C\ =1\ g\ glicine\ ·\frac{24.022\ g\ C}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 0.2934\ g\ C" />
<br />
Answer: m % C = 32%; m % H = 6.714%; m % N = 18.659%; m % O = 42.627%.mo f C in
1 g glicine = 0.2934 g{' '}

### 5. Determining the Empirical Formula

:::note Notes:
An empirical formula represents the lowest whole-number ratio of elements in a compound.  
To find an empirical formula when given percent composition we need:

1. To assume that you have 100 g of the unknown compound;
2. To convert the masses from Step 1 into moles using the molar mass;
3. To determine which element has the smallest mole value. Then divide all the mole values you calculated in Step 2 by this smallest value;
4. If any of your mole ratios aren’t whole numbers, multiply all numbers by the smallest possible factor that produces whole-number mole ratios for all the elements;
5. To write the empirical formula by attaching these whole-number mole ratios as subscripts to the chemical symbol of each element.
:::

#### Example

Calculate the empirical formula of the ionic compound calcium carbonate, used as building material. Elemental analysis indicates that it contains 40% calcium, 12% carbon, and 48% oxygen.  
**Given:** percent composition  
**Asked for:** empirical formula

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Assume a 100 g sample and calculate the number of moles of each element in that sample.  
**B.** Obtain the relative numbers of atoms of each element in the compound by dividing the number of moles of each element in the 100 g sample by the number of moles of the element present in the smallest amount.  
**C.** If the ratios are not integers, multiply all subscripts by the same number to give integral values.  
**D.** Because this is an ionic compound, identify the anion and cation and write the formula so that the charges are balanced.

**Solution:**  
**A.** A 100 g sample of calcium carbonate contains 40 g of calcium, 12 g of carbon, and 48 g of oxygen. Dividing the mass of each element in the 100 g sample by its molar mass gives the number of moles of each element in the sample:

<Math code="moles\ Ca\ =\ 40\ g\ Ca\frac{1\ mol\ Ca}{40.078\ g\ Ca}·100\%" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="moles\ C\ =\ 12\ g\ C\frac{1\ mol\ C}{12.011\ g\ C}·100\%" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="moles\ O\ =\ 48\ g\ O\frac{1\ mol\ O}{15.999\ g\ O}·100\%" />
<br />

**B.** To obtain the relative numbers of atoms of each element in the compound, divide the number of moles of each element in the 100-g sample by the number of moles of the element in the smallest amount, in this case calcium:

<Math code="Ca:\ \frac{0.9980\ mol\ C}{0.9980\ mol\ C}\ =\ 1.0" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="C:\ \frac{0.9990\ mol\ C}{0.9980\ mol\ Ca}\ =\ 1.001" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="O:\ \frac{3.0011\ mol\ O}{0.9980\ mol\ C}\ =\ 3.007" />
<br />

**C.** We can write the empirical formula of calcium carbonate as Ca<sub>1.000</sub>С<sub>1.001</sub>O<sub>3.007</sub>. The deviation from integral atomic ratios is small and can be attributed to minor experimental errors; therefore, the empirical formula is CaCO<sub>3</sub>.  
**D.** The calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is a cation, carbonate ion (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) is an anion. Hence the formula of the ionic compound is CaCO<sub>3</sub>

**Answer:** CaCO<sub>3</sub>

### 6. Determining the Empirical Formula from Combustion Analysis

:::note Notes:
To determine the empirical formula of a compound from Combustion  
Analysis, we need to take the following steps:

1. Determine the mass of the sample;
2. burn the sample in oxygen;
3. determine the masses of the combustion products;
4. determine the number of moles of each combustion product and then use the atomic masses of elements to calculate the masses of elements other than oxygen in the original sample;
5. find the mass of oxygen by finding the difference between the total mass of the organic compound and the mass of all other elements;
6. use element percentage to calculate moles of C, H, N, S in a 100 g sample;
7. divide the moles of each element by the moles of element present in the smallest amount;
8. multiply by nonintegral ratios as necessary to give small whole numbers.
:::

#### Example

Complete combustion of a 10.5 g sample of organic compound in oxygen yielded 33g of CO<sub>2</sub> and 13.5g of H<sub>2</sub>O. Determine the empirical formula of the organic compound.  
**Given:** mass of sample and mass of combustion products  
**Asked for:** empirical formula

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use the masses and molar masses of the combustion products, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, to calculate the masses of carbon and hydrogen present in the original sample of organic compound.  
**B.** Find the mass of oxygen by finding the difference between the total mass of the organic compound and the mass of carbon and hydrogen.  
**С.** Use those masses and the molar masses of the elements to calculate the empirical formula of the organic compound.

**Solution:**  
**A.** Upon combustion, 1 mol of CO<sub>2</sub> is produced for each mole of carbon atoms in the original sample. Similarly, 1 mol of H<sub>2</sub>O is produced for every 2 mol of hydrogen atoms present in the sample. The masses of carbon and hydrogen in the original sample can be calculated from these ratios, the masses of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, and their molar masses. Because the units of molar mass are grams per mole, we must first convert the masses from milligrams to grams:  
Find the mass of carbon: <Math top='15px' code="\frac{m(CO_2)}{M(CO_2)}:\frac{m(C)}{M(C)}=\frac{33g}{44.010\ g}:\frac{x\ g}{12.011\ g}=9.006g" />

Find the mass of hydrogen: <Math top='15px' code="\frac{m(H_2O)}{M(H_2O)}:\frac{m(H)}{M(H)}=\frac{13.5g}{18.015\ g}:\frac{x\ g}{2.0158\ g}=1.5105g" />

**B.** Find the mass of oxygen: m(O) = m (organic compound) - (m(C)+m(H)) = 10.5- (9.006+1.5105) = 0 (no oxygen)  
**C.** To obtain the relative numbers of atoms of both elements present, we need to calculate the number of moles of each and divide by the number of moles of the element present in the smallest amount:  
Moles C: <Math top='15px' code='n=\frac{m}{M}:\frac{9.006\ g}{12.011\ gmol^-1}=\ 0.75\ mol\ C' />

Moles H: <Math top='15px' code='n=\frac{m}{M}:\frac{1.5105\ g}{1.0079\ gmol^-1}=\ 1.5\ mol\ H' />

Dividing each number by the number of moles of the element present in the smaller amount gives

<Math top="15px" code="C:\ \frac{0.75}{0.75}=1.00" />
<br />
<Math top="15px" code="H:\ \frac{1.5}{0.75}=2.00" />
<br />
<br />
Thus, the organic compound contains a 1:2 ratio of moles of carbon to moles of hydrogen:
CH<sub>2</sub>. It is an empirical formula of the organic compound. In fact, the
molecular formula of the organic compound is C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, which is
consistent with our results.{' '}

**Answer:** The empirical formula is CH<sub>2</sub>.

### 7. Determining the Molecular Formula from Empirical Formula

Calculate the molecular formula of an unknown compound if its chemical analysis shows that it contains 20% carbon, 53.3% sulfur, and 26.7% oxygen by mass, and its experimentally determined molar mass is 120.008 g/mol.  
**Given:** percent composition and molar mass  
**Asked for:** molecular formula

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Assume 100 g of unknown compound. From the percentages given, calculate the empirical formula of the unknown compound.  
**B.** Calculate the formula mass and then divide the experimentally determined molar mass by the formula mass. This gives the number of formula units present.  
**C.** Multiply each subscript in the empirical formula by the number of formula units to give the molecular formula.

**Solution:**  
**A.** We begin by dividing the mass of each element in 100.0 g of unknown compound (20 g of carbon, 53.3 g of sulfur, 26.7 g of oxygen) by its molar mass. This gives the number of moles of each element in 100 g of unknown compound.

<center>
  <Math code="moles\ C\ =\ 20g\ C\ ·\frac{1mol\ C}{12.011g\ C}=\ 1.665\ mol\ C" />
</center>{' '}

<center>
  <Math code="moles\ S\ =\ 53.3g\ S\ ·\frac{1mol\ S}{32.064g\ C}=\ 1.669\ mol\ S" />
</center>

<center>
  <Math code="moles\ O\ =\ 20g\ O\ ·\frac{1mol\ O}{15.999g\ C}=\ 1.669\ mol\ O" />
</center>
To obtain the relative numbers of atoms of each element present, divide the number
of moles of each element by the number of moles of the element present in the least
amount:
<br />
<Math top="15px" code="C:\ \frac{1.665}{1.665}=\ 1.00" />
<br />
<br />
<Math top="15px" code="S:\ \frac{1.669}{1.669}=\ 1.002" />
<br />
<br />
<Math top="15px" code="O:\ \frac{1.669}{1.669}=\ 1.002" />
<br />
<br />
These results are fairly typical of actual experimental data. None of the atomic
ratios is exactly integral but all are within 5% of integral values. It is
reasonable to assume that such small deviations from integral values are due to
minor experimental errors, so round to the nearest integer. The empirical
formula of the unknown compound is thus CSO.{' '}

**B.** To determine the actual molecular formula, we must divide the experimentally determined molar mass by the formula mass. The formula mass is calculated by dividing the measured molar mass of the unknown compound (60.004 g/mol) by the calculated formula mass.

<Math top="-5px" code="\frac{120.008}{60.004}= 2.00 = 2CSO" />
<br />

**C.** There are two CSO formula units in unknown compound, so the molecular formula must be (CSO)<sub>2</sub>= C<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

**Answer:** C<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>

### 8. Chemical Equations

:::note Notes:
A chemical reaction changes only the distribution of atoms, not the number of atoms.  
**Steps in Balancing a Chemical Equation**

1.  Identify the most complex substance.
2.  Beginning with that substance, choose an element that appears in only one reactant and one product, if possible. Adjust the coefficients to obtain the same number of atoms of this element on both sides.
3.  Balance polyatomic ions (if present) as a unit.
4.  Balance the remaining atoms, usually ending with the least complex substance and using fractional coefficients if necessary. If a fractional coefficient has been used, multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator to obtain whole numbers for the coefficients.
5.  Count the numbers of atoms of each kind on both sides of the equation to be sure that the chemical equation is balanced.  
:::

#### Example 1.

The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of propanol in the laboratory is as follows: C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8(g)</sub>+5O<sub>2(g)</sub> → 3CO<sub>2(g)</sub>+4H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>  
Construct a table showing how to interpret the information in this equation in terms of

1. a single molecule of propanol.
2. moles of reactants and products.
3. grams of reactants and products represented by 1 mol of propanol.
4. numbers of molecules of reactants and products represented by 1 mol of propanol.

**Given:** balanced chemical equation  
**Asked for:** molecule, mole, and mass relationships

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use the coefficients from the balanced chemical equation to determine both the molecular and mole ratios.  
**B.** Use the molar masses of the reactants and products to convert from moles to grams.  
**C.** Use Avogadro’s number to convert from moles to the number of molecules.

**Solution:**  
This equation is balanced as written: each side has 3 carbon atoms, 10 oxygen atoms, and 8 hydrogen atoms. We can therefore use the coefficients directly to obtain the desired information.  
**A.** One molecule of propanol reacts with 5 molecules of O<sub>2</sub> to yield 3 molecules of CO<sub>2</sub> and 4 molecules of H<sub>2</sub>O.  
**B.** One mole of propanol reacts with 5 mol of O<sub>2</sub> to yield 3 mol of CO<sub>2</sub> and 4 mol of H<sub>2</sub>O.  
**C.** To interpret the equation in terms of masses of reactants and products, we need their molar masses and the mole ratios from part b. The molar masses in grams per mole are as follows: propanol, 60.004; O<sub>2</sub>, 31.9988; CO<sub>2</sub>, 44.010; and H<sub>2</sub>O, 18.015.  
One mole of propanol contains Avogadro’s number (6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup>) of propanol molecules.  
Thus 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> propanol molecules react with (5 × 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup>) = 11.6242 × 10<sup>23</sup>oxygen molecules to yield (3 × 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup>) = 18.066 × 10<sup>23</sup> molecules of CO<sub>2</sub> and (4 × 6.022 × 1023) = 24.088 × 10<sup>23</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O.

#### Example 2.

The reaction of the nonane C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub> with oxygen gives carbon dioxide and water. Write and balance the equation for this reaction.  
**Given:** reactants and products  
**Asked for:** balanced chemical equation

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Identify the products and the reactants and then write the unbalanced chemical equation.  
**B.** Follow the steps for balancing a chemical equation.

**Solution:**  
**Identify the most complex substance.**  
We will assume initially that the final balanced chemical equation contains 1 molecule or formula unit of C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>.  
**Adjust the coefficients.** Try to adjust the coefficients of the molecules on the other side of the equation to obtain the same numbers of atoms on both sides. Because one molecule of n-nonane contains 9 carbon atoms, we need 9CO<sub>2</sub> molecules, each of which contains 1 carbon atom, on the right side:  
C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>→9CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O  
**Balance polyatomic ions as a unit.** There are no polyatomic ions to be considered in this reaction.  
**Balance the remaining atoms.** Because one molecule of n-nonane contains 20 hydrogen atoms, we need 10H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, each of which contains 2 hydrogen atoms, on the right side:  
C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>+ O<sub>2</sub>→ 9CO<sub>2</sub>+10H<sub>2</sub>O  
The carbon and hydrogen atoms are now balanced, but we have 28 oxygen atoms on the right side and only 2 oxygen atoms on the left. We can balance the oxygen atoms by adjusting the coefficient in front of the least complex substance, O<sub>2</sub>, on the reactant side:  
C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>+ 14O<sub>2</sub>→ 9CO<sub>2</sub>+10H<sub>2</sub>O  
**Check your work.** The equation is now balanced, and there are no fractional coefficients: there are 9 carbon atoms, 20 hydrogen atoms, and 28 oxygen atoms on each side._Always check to be sure that a chemical equation is balanced._

### 8.1 Converting between Masses of Reactant and Product

:::note Notes:
The method of converting the mass of any reagent or product into the mass of any other reagent or product using a balanced chemical equation contains the general steps:

1.  Convert the mass of one substance (substance A) to the corresponding number of moles using its molar mass.
2.  From the balanced chemical equation, obtain the number of moles of another substance (B) from the number of moles of substance A using the appropriate mole ratio (the ratio of their coefficients).
3.  Convert the number of moles of substance B to mass using its molar mass. It is important to remember that some species are in excess by virtue of the reaction conditions. For example, if a substance reacts with the oxygen in air, then oxygen is in obvious (but unstated) excess.

Converting amounts of substances to moles—and vice versa—is the key to all stoichiometry problems, whether the amounts are given in units of mass (grams or kilograms), weight (pounds or tons), or volume (liters or gallons).  
The molar masses of the reactants and the products are used as conversion factors so that you can calculate the mass of product from the mass of reactant and vice versa.
:::

#### Example

Calculate how much sodium is needed to react with 160 g of oxygen.  
**Given:** reactants, products, and mass of one reactant  
**Asked for:** mass of another reactant

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.  
**B.** Convert mass of oxygen to moles. From the mole ratio in the balanced chemical equation, determine the number of moles of sodium required. Then convert the moles of sodium to the equivalent mass in g.

**Solution:**  
**A.** We first use the information given to write a balanced chemical equation. Because we know the identity of both the reactants and the product, we can write the reaction as follows:

<center>
  Na(s)+O<sub>2</sub>(g) →Na<sub>2</sub>O(s)
</center>
This equation is not balanced because there are two oxygen atoms on the left side
and only one on the right, 1 sodium atom on the left side and 2 sodium atoms on the
right. Assigning a coefficient of 2 to Na<sub>2</sub>O and 4 to Na gives the balanced
chemical equation:
<center>
  4Na(s)+O<sub>2</sub>(g) →2Na<sub>2</sub>O(s)
</center>
Thus 4 mol of Na react with 1 mol of O<sub>2</sub> to produce 2 mol of Na
<sub>2</sub>O.{' '}

**B.** Using the molar mass of O<sub>2</sub> (32.00 g/mol to four significant figures) we can calculate the number of moles of O<sub>2</sub> contained in this mass of O<sub>2</sub>

<center>
  <Math code="n(O_2)\ =\frac{160\ g}{32.00\ gmol^-1}=\ 5\ mol\ (O_2)" />
</center>
1. Now use the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation to obtain the number
of moles of Na needed to react with this number of moles of O<sub>2</sub>:<center>
  <Math code="\frac{4\ mol\ of\ Na}{1\ mol\ of\ O_2}=\frac{x\ mol\ of\ Na}{5\ mol\ of\ O_2}" />
</center>
<center>x = 20 mol of Na</center>
2. The molar mass of Na (22.98 g/mol) allows us to calculate the corresponding mass
of Na:
<center>
  <Math code="m(O2)\ = n\ ·\ M\ =\ 20\ mol\ ·\frac{22.98\ g}{mol}=\ 459.6\ g\ (Na)" />
</center>{' '}

**Answer:** 459.6 g of sodium is needed to react with 160 g of oxygen

### 9. Limiting Reactants

:::note Notes:
To determine the mass of the reaction product, if the masses of two reactants are known, we need:

1. Determine the number of moles of each reactant.
2. Compare the mole ratio of the reactants with the ratio in the balanced chemical equation to determine which reactant is limiting.
3. Calculate the number of moles of product that can be obtained from the limiting reactant.
4. Convert the number of moles of product to mass of product.
:::

#### Example

Given 20 g each of ammonia and hydrogen chloride. How many grams of ammonium chloride can be prepared from this reaction?  
**Given:** reactants, products, and mass of reactants  
**Asked for:** mass of product

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Balance the chemical equation for the reaction.  
**B.** Use each molar mass to convert from mass to moles.  
**C.** Using mole ratios, determine which substance is the limiting reactant. After identifying the limiting reactant, use mole ratios based on the number of moles of limiting reactant to determine the number of moles of the product.  
**D.** Convert from moles of product to the mass of the product.

**Solution:**  
We always begin by writing the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:

<center>
  NH<sub>3(g)</sub> + HCl<sub>(g)</sub> = NH<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>(g)</sub>
</center>
We need to calculate the number of moles of ammonia and hydrogen chloride that are
present in 20 g of each.
<center>
  <Math code="n(NH_3)\ =\frac{20.00\ g\ g}{17.00gmol^-1}=\ 1.18 mol" />
</center>
<center>
  <Math code="n(NCl)\ = \frac{20.00\ g}{36.453gmol^-1}=\ 1.549 mol" />
</center>
C. The number of moles of NH<sub>3</sub> exceeds the number of moles of NCl. Because
the reactants both have coefficients of 1 in the balanced chemical equation, the
mole ratio is 1:1. We have 1.18 mol of NH<sub>3</sub> and 0.549 mol of HCl, so
HCl is the limiting reactant and NH<sub>3</sub> is in excess. The coefficient in
the balanced chemical equation for the product (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) is also 1, so the
mole ratio of HCl and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl is also 1:1. This means that given 0.549 mol
of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, the amount of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl produced must also be 0.549 mol.
D. The final step is to determine the mass of ammonium chloride that can be formed,
which we do by multiplying the number of moles by the molar mass:
<center>
  m(NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) = n ·M = 0.549 mol · 53.453 gmol<sup>-1</sup>=29.346 (g)
</center>
Thus 29.346 g of ammonium chloride can be prepared in this reaction.{' '}

**Answer:** mass of ammonium chloride is 29.346 g

> **Explain a solution strategy using key expressions.**

### 10. Percent Yield

:::note Notes:
The amount of product calculated by the reaction equation represents the theoretical yield, which is the amount you would get if the reaction went perfectly and your product purification method was 100% effective. In fact, you almost always get less product than theoretically possible due to mechanical losses (such as spills), separation procedures that are not 100% effective, competing reactions that form unwanted products, and reactions that just don't pass all the way to completion, resulting in a mixture of products and reagents. Thus, the actual yield, the measured mass of the products resulting from the reaction, is almost always less than the theoretical yield (often much less). The percentage yield of the reaction is the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield multiplied by 100 to get a percentage:

<center>
  <Math code="percend\ yield\ =\frac{actual\ yield\ =\ (g)}{theoretical\ yield\ =\ (g)}·\ 100%" />
</center>
:::

If 160 g of CuO is heated with 2g hydrogen, 48 g of a pure copper is obtained. What is the percent yield?  
Given: masses of reactants and product  
Asked for: percent yield

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Write the balanced chemical equation.  
**B.** Convert from mass of reactants and product to moles using molar masses and then use mole ratios to determine which is the limiting reactant. Based on the number of moles of the limiting reactant, use mole ratios to determine the theoretical yield.  
**C.** Calculate the percent yield by dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield and multiplying by 100.

**Solution:**  
**A.** From the formulas given for the reactants and the products, we see that the chemical equation is balanced as written. According to the equation, 1 mol of each reactant combines to give 1 mol of product plus 1 mol of water.

<center>
  CuO + H<sub>2</sub> = Cu + H<sub>2</sub>O
</center>{' '}

**B.** To determine which reactant is limiting, we need to know their numbers of mol:

<center>
  <Math top="10px" code="n(CuO)\ =\frac{160\ g}{79.545\ gmol^-1} 2.011\ mol" />
</center>{' '}

<center>
  <Math top="15px" code="n(H_2) =\frac{2\ g}{2.014\ gmol^-1} 0.993\ mol" />
</center>
The reaction requires a 1:1 mole ratio of the two reactants, so hydrogen is the limiting
reactant. Based on the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation, 1 mol of hydrogen
yields 1 mol of copper. We can therefore obtain only a maximum of 0.993 mol of cupper.
To calculate the corresponding mass of procaine, we use its number of mol multiply
by molar mass:
<center>
  m(Cu) = n ∙ M = 0.993 mol ∙ 63.546 gmol<sup>-1</sup> = 63.104 g (theoretical
  yield)
</center>{' '}

**C.** The actual yield was only 48 g of cupper, so the percent yield was

<center>
  <Math
    top="5px"
    code="percend\ yield\ (Cu)\ =\frac{48\ g}{63.104\ g}∙\ 100%\ =\ 76.065%"
  />
</center>{' '}

**Answer:** The actual yield of copper is 76.065%.

### 11. Atom economy

:::note Notes:
No atoms are gained or lost in a chemical reaction. However, some atoms in the reactants may not end up in the desired product. They instead form other products, and so are regarded as by-products.  
The atom economy of a reaction is a measure of the amount of starting materials that end up as useful products. It is important for sustainable development and for economic reasons to use reactions with high atom economy. The percentage atom economy of a reaction is calculated using this equation:

<center>
  <Math code="atom\ economy\ =\frac{total\ Mr\ of\ the\ desired\ product}{total\ Mr\ of\ all\ reactants}·\ 100%" />
</center>
The ideal atom economy, known as 100% atom economy, for a chemical reaction is taken
as the process where all reactant atoms are found in the desired product. 
:::

#### Example

Hydrogen can be manufactured by reacting methane with steam:  
CH<sub>4</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(g) → 3H<sub>2</sub>(g) + CO(g). Using a balanced equation, determine the atom economy for the reaction.  
**Given:** balanced equation  
**Asked for:** atom economy for the reaction relative to hydrogen

**Strategy:**

1. We calculate the molecular mass of all compounds
2. Calculate the atom economy for the reaction

**Solution:**
Mr(CH<sub>4</sub>) = 16;  
Mr(H<sub>2</sub>O) = 18;  
Mr(H<sub>2</sub>) =2;  
total Mr of desired product = 3∙2 = 6;  
Mr(СO) =28

<Math code="atom\ economy\ =\frac{6}{16+18}·\ 100%\ =\ 17.6%" />{' '}

### 12. Ionic Equations

:::note Notes:
The chemical equation for a reaction in solution can be written in three ways. The overall chemical equation shows all the substances present in their undissociated forms; the complete ionic equation shows all the substances present in the form in which they actually exist in solution; and the net ionic equation is derived from the complete ionic equation by omitting all spectator ions, ions that occur on both sides of the equation with the same coefficients. Net ionic equations demonstrate that many different combinations of reactants can give the same net chemical reaction.  
:::

#### Example 1.

Write the overall chemical equation, the complete ionic equation, and the net ionic equation for the reaction of aqueous aluminum chloride with aqueous potassium phosphate to give solid aluminum phosphate and a solution of potassium chloride.  
**Given:** reactants and products  
**Asked for:** overall, complete ionic, and net ionic equations

**Strategy:**

1. Write and balance the overall chemical equation.
2. Write all the soluble reactants and products in their dissociated form to give the complete ionic equation.
3. Then cancel species that appear on both sides of the complete ionic equation to give the net ionic equation.

**Solution:**  
1.From the information given, we can write and balance the overall chemical equation:  
AlCl<sub>3(aq)</sub>+K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4(aq)</sub>→AlPO<sub>4(s)</sub>+3KCl<sub>(aq)</sub>  
This is the overall balanced chemical equation for the reaction, showing the reactants and products in their undissociated form. To obtain the complete ionic equation, we write each soluble reactant and product in dissociated form:  
Al<sup>3+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> +3Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> +3K<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>+PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>→AlPO<sub>4</sub>(s)+3K<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>+3Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>  
The three Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>ions and the three 3K<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>ions that appear on both sides of the equation are spectator ions that can be canceled to give the net ionic equation:  
Al<sup>3+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>+2PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>→ AlPO<sub>4(s)</sub>

#### Example 2.

Write the overall chemical equation, the complete ionic equation, and the net ionic equation for the reaction of aqueous sodium carbonate with aqueous hydrochloric acid to give solid silver phosphate and a solution of sodium fluoride.  
**Given:** reactants and products  
**Asked for:** overall, complete ionic, and net ionic equations

**Strategy:**

1. Write and balance the overall chemical equation.
2. Write all the soluble reactants and products in their dissociated form to give the complete ionic equation.
3. Then cancel species that appear on both sides of the complete ionic equation to give the net ionic equation.

**Solution:**

1. overall chemical equation:

> **Explain a solution strategy using key expressions.**

### 13. Solution Concentrations

:::note Notes:
The most common unit of concentration is molarity, which is also the most useful for calculations involving the stoichiometry of reactions in solution. The molarity (M) of a solution is the number of moles of solute present in exactly 1L of solution. Molarity is also the number of millimoles of solute present in exactly 1 mL of solution:

<center>
  <Math code="molarity\ \frac{moles\ of\ solute}{liters\ of\ solution}=\frac{moles\ of\ solute}{milliliters\ of\ solution}" />
</center>{' '}

<center>
  <Math top="15px" code="C\ =\frac{n}{v}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ " />
  <Math code="n=C\ ∙\ V" />
</center>{' '}

The units of molarity are moles per liter of solution (mol/L), abbreviated as M. In chemical notation, square brackets around the name or formula of the solute represent the concentration of a solute. So

<center>[NaOH]=1.00M[NaOH]=1.00M</center>
<br />
is read as “the concentration of sodium hydroxide is 1.00 molar.” Solutions of
known concentration can be prepared either by dissolving a known mass of solute
in a solvent and diluting to a desired final volume or by diluting the
appropriate volume of a more concentrated solution (a stock solution) to the
desired final volume. 
:::

#### Example 1.

Calculate the number of moles of sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) in 3.00 L of 0.150 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.  
**Given:** identity of solute and volume and molarity of solution  
**Asked for:** amount of solute in moles

**Strategy:**  
Use the formula for finding the number of moles  
n = С∙V

**Solution:**  
n(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) = 0.150∙3.00 = 0.45M  
**Answer:** n(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) = 0.45M

#### Example 2.

The solution contains 25.0 g of copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate, CuSO<sub>4</sub>·5H<sub>2</sub>O, in enough ethanol to make exactly 800 mL of solution. What is the molar concentration of CuSO<sub>4</sub>·5H<sub>2</sub>O?  
**Given:** mass of solute and volume of solution  
**Asked for:** concentration (M)

**Strategy:**
To find the number of moles of CuSO<sub>4</sub>·5H<sub>2</sub>O, divide the mass of the compound by its molar mass. Calculate the molarity of the solution by dividing the number of moles of solute by the volume of the solution in liters.

**Solution:**  
The molar mass of CuSO<sub>4</sub>·5H<sub>2</sub>O is 250 g/mol.  
Therefore, moles CuSO4·5H2O = (<Math top='15px' code="\frac{0.25\ mol}{250\ g/mol}" />) = 0.1mol  
The volume of the solution in liters is  
volume=800mL=0.800L volume  
Molarity is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution, so the molarity of the solution is

<center>
  <Math code="C\ =\frac{0.1\ mol}{0.8\ L}=\ 0.125M" />
</center>{' '}

**Answer:** [CuSO4·5H2O] = 0.125M

#### Example 3.

Calculate the mass of acetic acid needed to prepare 500 ml of its 0.2 M solution. Acetic acid has a molar mass of 60 g/mol.  
**Given:** molarity, volume, and molar mass of solute  
**Asked for:** mass of acetic acid

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Calculate the number of moles of acetic acid contained in the indicated volume of dilute solution by multiplying the volume of the solution by its molarity.  
**B.** To determine the mass of acetic acid multiply its number of moles by the molar mass

Solution:  
**A.** We begin by using equation n = C∙V to calculate the number of moles of acetic acid contained in 500 mL of the solution:  
n (acetic acid) = 0.2M∙0.5L=0.1 mol  
**B.** Now we must determine the mass of acetic acid:  
m(acetic acid )=n∙Molar mass  
m(acetic acid )=0.1mol∙60g/mol=6 g  
**Answer:** m(acetic acid )=6 g

#### Example 4.

What volume of a 2.0 M KOH stock solution is necessary to prepare 400 mL 0.1 M KOH?  
**Given:** volume and molarity of dilute solution  
**Asked for:** volume of stock solution

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Calculate the number of moles of potassium hydroxide contained in the indicated volume of dilute solution by multiplying the volume of the solution by its molarity.  
**B.** To determine the volume of stock solution needed, divide the number of moles of potassium hydroxide by the molarity of the stock solution.

**Solution:**
Determine the number of moles of potassium hydroxide in 400 ml of 0.1 M solution:

<center>n(KOH) = 0.1M∙0.4L=0.04 mol </center>{' '}

**B.** We must now determine the volume of the 2.00 M stock solution that contains this amount of potassium hydroxide:

<center>
  <Math code="V\ =\frac{n}{C}" />
</center>
<center>
  <Math code="V\ (stock\ solution)\ \frac{0.04\ mol}{0.2\ M}=\ 0.2\ L" />
</center>

**Answer:** volume of a 2.0 M KOH stock solution is 0.2 L

#### Example 5.

What are the concentrations of all species derived from the solutes in these aqueous solutions?

1. 1.2 M Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
2. 1.5 M Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>
3. 2.5 M CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>  
   **Given:** molarity  
   **Asked for:** concentrations

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Classify each compound as either a strong electrolyte or a nonelectrolyte.  
**B.** If the compound is a nonelectrolyte, its concentration is the same as the molarity of the solution. If the compound is a strong electrolyte, determine the number of each ion contained in one formula unit. Find the concentration of each species by multiplying the number of each ion by the molarity of the solution.

**Solution:**

1.  Sodium sulfate is an ionic compound that is a strong electrolyte in aqueous solution:  
    Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4(aq)</sub> ↔2Na<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>  
    One formula unit of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> produces two Na<sup>+</sup> ions and one SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> ion, so a 1.2 M Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution contains 2.4 M Na<sup>+</sup> and 1.2 M SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> that is, [Na<sup>+</sup>] 2.4 M and [SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ] = 1.2 M.
2.  Aluminum nitrate is an ionic compound that is a strong electrolyte in aqueous solution:  
    Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3(aq)</sub> ↔Al<sup>3+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 3NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>  
    One formula unit of Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> produces one Al<sup>3+</sup> ion and three NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions, so a 1.5 M Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>solution contains 1.5 M Al<sup>3+</sup> and 3 M NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> that is, [Al<sup>3+</sup>] 1.5 M and [NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] = 4.5 M.
3.  The formula CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub> represents ketone acetone. Ketone are covalent compounds that dissolve in water to give solutions of neutral molecules. Thus ketone are nonelectrolytes. The only solute species in solution is therefore CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub> molecules, so [CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>] = 2.5 M.  
    **Answer:** [CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>] = 2.5 M

### 14. Units for Concentration

:::note Notes:
Different units are used to express the concentrations of a solution depending on the application. The concentration of a solution is the quantity of solute in a given quantity of solution. It can be expressed in several ways: molarity (moles of solute per liter of solution); mole fraction, the ratio of the number of moles of solute to the total number of moles of substances present; mass percentage, the ratio of the mass of the solute to the mass of the solution times 100; parts per thousand (ppt), grams of solute per kilogram of solution; parts per million (ppm), milligrams of solute per kilogram of solution; parts per billion (ppb), micrograms of solute per kilogram of solution; and molality (m), the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.

#### Example 

For 120 ml of 20% sulfuric acid solution (density 0.72g / ml) calculate  
1. the mass of the solution
2. the mole fraction
3. the molarity
4. the molality  

**Given:** volume, percent and density  
**Asked for:** mole fraction, molarity, and molality  

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use the density of the solution to calculate the mass of 120 mL solution.  
**B.** Convert grams of solute and solvent to moles of solute and solvent. Calculate the mole fraction of solute by dividing the moles of solute by the total number of moles of substances present in solution.  
**С.** Calculate the molarity of the solution: moles of solute per liter of solution. Determine the molality of the solution by dividing the number of moles of solute by the kilograms of solvent.  

**Solution:**  
**А.** m= ρ∙V
<center>
  <Math top='-10px' code="m(solution)\ =\ \frac{0.04\ mol}{0.2\ M}\ ·\ 120\ ml\ =\ 86.4\ g" />
</center>

**В.** To calculate the mole fraction of sulfuric acid in the solution, we need to know the mass of sulfuric acid and the number moles of both sulfuric acid and water. The mass of sulfuric acid is  
<center>
  <Math code="m(sulfuric\ acid)\ =\ \frac{W\ ·\ m\ (solution)}{100%}" />
</center><br/>
<center>
  <Math code="m(sulfuric\ acid)\ =\ \frac{20%\ ·\ 86.4\ g}{100%}\ =\ 17.28\ g" />
</center><br/>
<center>
  <Math code="n(sulfuric\ acid)\ =\ \frac{m}{M}" />
</center><br/>
<center>
  <Math code="n(sulfuric\ acid)\ =\ \frac{17.28\ g}{98\ g/mol}\ =\ 0.176\ mol" />
</center><br/>
<center>
  <Math code="m(H_2O)=m(solution)-m(solut)" />
</center><br/>
<center>
  <Math code="m(H_2O)=86.4-17.28=69.12\ g" />
</center><br/>
<center>
  <Math code="n(H_2O)\ =\frac{69.12\ g}{18\ g/mol} =\ 3.84\ mol" />
</center><br/>
<center>
  <Math code="the\ mole\ fraction\ =\ \frac{moles\ of\ solute}{total\ moles\ present}\ =\ \frac{0.176}{0.176+3.84}=\ 0,0438" />
</center>

**С.** The molarity of the solution is the number of moles of sulfuric acid per liter of solution. We already know the number of moles of sulfuric acid, so the molarity is  
<center>
  <Math top='-5px' code="С(sulfuric\ acid)\ =\ \frac{0.176\ mol}{0.12\ L}\ =\ 1.47M" />
</center>
The molality of the solution is the number of moles of sulfuric acid per kilogram of solvent. Because we know the number of moles of sulfuric acid in 69.12 g of water, the calculation is again straight forward:  
<center>
  <Math top='5px' code="molality\ of\ the\ solution\ =\ \frac{0.176\ mol}{0.06912\ kg}\ =\ 2.546 mol/kg" />
</center>

**Answer:**  
1. mass of the solution = 86.4g
2. mole fraction = 0.0438
3. molarity = 1.47M
4. molality = 2.546 mol/kg
