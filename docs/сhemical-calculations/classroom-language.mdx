### 1. The molecular mass of a substance

:::note Notes:
The molecular mass of a substance is the sum of the average masses of the atoms in one molecule of a substance. It is calculated by adding together the atomic masses of the elements in the substance, each multiplied by its subscript (written or implied) in the molecular formula. Because the units of atomic mass are atomic mass units, the units of molecular mass are also atomic mass units. The procedure for calculating molecular masses is illustrated in Example 1.
:::

#### Example

Calculate the molecular mass of propanol, whose condensed structural formula is  
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH  
**Given:** molecule  
**Asked for:** molecular mass

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Determine the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.  
**B.** Obtain the atomic masses of each element from the periodic table and multiply the atomic mass of each element by the number of atoms of that element.  
**C.** Add together the masses to give the molecular mass.

**Solution:**  
**A.** The molecular formula of propanol may be written in three different ways: CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub>OH (which illustrates the presence of a propyl group, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>−, and an −OH group), C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>OH, and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O; all show that propanol has three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom.  
**B.** Taking the atomic masses from the periodic table, we obtain:  
3×atomic; mass of carbon=3 atoms · (12.011amu/atom) =36.033amu  
8×atomic; mass of hydrogen=8 atoms · (1.0079amu/atom) =8.0632amu  
1×atomic; mass of oxygen=1atoms · (15.9994amu/atom) =15.9994amu  
**C.** Adding together the masses gives the molecular mass:  
36.033amu + 8.0632amu + 15.9994amu = 60.0956amu  
**Alternatively,** we could have used unit conversions to reach the result in one step:Mr(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O) = [3 atoms · (12.011amu/1atom C)] + [8 atoms H · (1.0079amu/1atom H)] + [1atoms O · (15.9994amu/1atom O)]

**Answer:**  
the molecular mass of propanol is 60.0956amu or Mr(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O) =60.0956amu

### 2. Molar Mass

:::note Notes:
The molar mass is defined as the mass in grams of 1 mol of that substance. One mole of isotopically pure carbon-12 has a mass of 12 g. For an element, the molar mass is the mass of 1 mol of atoms of that element; for a covalent molecular compound, it is the mass of 1 mol of molecules of that compound; for an ionic compound, it is the mass of 1 mol of formula units. That is, the molar mass of a substance is the mass (in grams per mole) of 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> atoms, molecules, or formula units of that substance. In each case, the number of grams in 1 mol is the same as the number of atomic mass units that describe the atomic mass, the molecular mass, or the formula mass, respectively. The molar mass of any substance is its atomic mass, molecular mass, or formula mass in grams per mole. The periodic table lists the atomic mass of carbon as 12.011 amu; the average molar mass of carbon—the mass of 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> carbon atoms—is therefore 12.011 g/mol

#### Example 1.

Calculate the number of moles and molecules of oxygen in 4g oxygen molecules with the formula O<sub>2</sub>  
**Given:** mass and molecular formula  
**Asked for:** number of moles and number of molecules

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use the molecular formula of the compound to calculate its molecular mass in grams per mole.  
**B.** Convert from mass to moles by dividing the mass given by the compound’s molar mass.  
**C.** Convert from moles to molecules by multiplying the number of moles by Avogadro’s number.

**Solution:**  
**A.** The molecular mass of oxygen can be calculated from its molecular formula using the method:  
Mr(O<sub>2</sub>) = (2 atoms of O) · (15.9994amu/atom O) = 31.9988amu  
The molar mass of oxygen is 31.9988 g/mol  
**B.** The number of moles of oxygen present in 4g can be calculated by dividing the mass (in grams) by the molar mass (in grams per mole):

<center>
  <Math code="n=\frac{m}{M}" />
</center>
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="n(O2)=\frac{4g}{31.9988\ gmol^{-1}}= 0.125\ mol" />
</center>{' '}

**C.** To calculate the number of molecules in the sample, we multiply the number of moles by Avogadro’s number:

<center>
  N (number of molecules) = N<sub>a</sub>· n
</center>
<center>
  N(O<sub>2</sub>) = 6,02 · 1023 mol<sup>-1</sup> · 0.125 mol = 0.7525 · 10
  <sup>23</sup> molecules
</center>{' '}

**Answer:**  
n(O<sub>2</sub>) = 0.125 mol; N(O<sub>2</sub>) = 0.7525 × 10<sup>23</sup> molecules

#### Example 2.

Calculate the mass of 1.75 mol of each compound:

1. SO<sub>2</sub> (sulfur dioxide)
2. Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (sodium carbonate)  
   **Given:** number of moles and molecular or empirical formula  
   **Asked for:** mass

**Strategy:**
**A.** Calculate the molecular mass of the compound in grams from its molecular formula (if covalent) or empirical formula (if ionic).  
**B.** Convert from moles to mass by multiplying the moles of the compound given by its molar mass.

**Solution:**  
We begin by calculating the molecular mass of SO2 and the formula mass of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.  
**A.** The molar mass of SO2 is obtained from its molecular mass as follows:  
Mr(SO<sub>2</sub>) = (1 atom of S) · (32.065amu/atom S) + (2 atoms of O) · (15.9994amu/atom O) =32.065amu + 31.9988amu = 64.0638amu  
The molar mass of SO<sub>2</sub> is 64.0638 g/mol.  
The mass of 1.75 mol of SO2 is calculated as follows:  
m(SO<sub>2</sub>) = n · M  
m(SO<sub>2</sub>) = 1.75 · 64.0638 gmol<sup>-1</sup> = 112.1165g  
**B.** The formula mass of Na2CO3 is obtained as follows:  
The formula mass [Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>] = [(2 atoms of Na) · (22.98977amu/atom Na) + (1 atom of C) · (12.011amu/atom C)+ (3 atoms of O) · (15.9994amu/atom C)] = 45.97954amu +12.011amu +47.9982amu =105.98874amu  
The molar mass of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is 105.98874 g/mol.  
The mass of 1.75 mol of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is calculated as follows:  
m(Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) = n · M  
m(Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) = 1.75 · 105.98874gmol<sup>-1</sup> = 185.48029g

**Answer:**
m(SO<sub>2</sub>) = 112.1165g; m(Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) = 185.48029g

### 4. Calculating Mass Percentages

:::note Notes:
Mass percentage is calculated as the mass of a component divided by the total mass of the mixture, multiplied by 100%<br/>

<center>
  <Math code="\%\ by\ mass =\frac{mass(component)}{mass(mixture)}·100\%" />
</center>
<br />
The percent composition AxBy of a compound can also be determined from the
formula of the compound. The subscripts in the formula are first used to
calculate the mass of each element in one mole of the compound. That is divided
by the molar mass of the compound and multiplied by 100%
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="\%\ by\ mass\ (A) =\frac{m(A\ in\ 1\ mol\ of\ the\ compound)}{molar\ mass(A_xB_y)}·100\%" />
</center>
<br />
:::

#### Example

Glycine is the simplest amino acid that reduces psycho-emotional stress and increases mental productivity. Its molecular formula is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. Calculate the mass percentage of each element in glycine. Calculate the mass of carbon in a 1.00 g packet of Equal, assuming it is pure glycine.  
**Given:** molecular formula and mass of sample  
**Asked for:** mass percentage of all elements and mass of one element in sample

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use atomic masses from the periodic table to calculate the molar mass of glycine.  
**B.** Divide the mass of each element by the molar mass of glycine then multiply by 100 to obtain percentages.  
**C.** To find the mass of an element contained in a given mass of glycine, multiply the mass of glycine by the mass percentage of that element, expressed as a decimal.

**Solution:**  
**A.** We calculate the mass of each element in 1 mol of glycine and the molar mass of glycine, here to three decimal places:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>2 C</td>
    <td>(2 mol C)(12.011 g/mol C) =</td>
    <td>24.022 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5 H</td>
    <td>(5 mol H)(1.008 g/mol H) =</td>
    <td>5.04 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1N</td>
    <td>(1 mol N)(14.007 g/mol N) =</td>
    <td>14.007 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2O</td>
    <td>(2 mol O)(15.999 g/mol O) =</td>
    <td>31.998 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>
    </td>
    <td>molar mass of aspartame</td>
    <td>75.067 g/mol</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**B.** To calculate the mass percentage of each element, we divide the mass of each element in the compound by the molar mass of glycine and then multiply by 100 to obtain percentages, here reported to two decimal places:

<Math code="m\ \%\ C\ =\frac{24.022\ g\ C}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 32\%\ C" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="m\ \%\ H\ =\frac{5.04\ g\ H}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 6.714\%\ H" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="m\ \%\ N\ =\frac{14.007\ g\ N}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 18.659\%\ N" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="m\ \%\ O\ =\frac{31.998 \ g\ O}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 42.627\%\ O" />
<br />
As a check, we can add the percentages together: 32% + 6.714% + 18.659% + 42.627%
= 100.00% If you obtain a total that differs from 100% by more than about ±1%, there
must be an error somewhere in the calculation.{' '}

**C.** The mass of carbon in 1.00 g of glycine is calculated as follows:

<Math code="m\ of\ C\ =1\ g\ glicine\ ·\frac{24.022\ g\ C}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 0.2934\ g\ C" />
<br />
Answer: m % C = 32%; m % H = 6.714%; m % N = 18.659%; m % O = 42.627%.mo f C in
1 g glicine = 0.2934 g{' '}

### 5. Determining the Empirical Formula

:::note Notes:
An empirical formula represents the lowest whole-number ratio of elements in a compound.  
To find an empirical formula when given percent composition we need:

1. To assume that you have 100 g of the unknown compound;
2. To convert the masses from Step 1 into moles using the molar mass;
3. To determine which element has the smallest mole value. Then divide all the mole values you calculated in Step 2 by this smallest value;
4. If any of your mole ratios aren’t whole numbers, multiply all numbers by the smallest possible factor that produces whole-number mole ratios for all the elements;
5. To write the empirical formula by attaching these whole-number mole ratios as subscripts to the chemical symbol of each element.
:::

#### Example

Calculate the empirical formula of the ionic compound calcium carbonate, used as building material. Elemental analysis indicates that it contains 40% calcium, 12% carbon, and 48% oxygen.  
**Given:** percent composition  
**Asked for:** empirical formula

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Assume a 100 g sample and calculate the number of moles of each element in that sample.  
**B.** Obtain the relative numbers of atoms of each element in the compound by dividing the number of moles of each element in the 100 g sample by the number of moles of the element present in the smallest amount.  
**C.** If the ratios are not integers, multiply all subscripts by the same number to give integral values.  
**D.** Because this is an ionic compound, identify the anion and cation and write the formula so that the charges are balanced.

**Solution:**  
**A.** A 100 g sample of calcium carbonate contains 40 g of calcium, 12 g of carbon, and 48 g of oxygen. Dividing the mass of each element in the 100 g sample by its molar mass gives the number of moles of each element in the sample:

<Math code="moles\ Ca\ =\ 40\ g\ Ca\frac{1\ mol\ Ca}{40.078\ g\ Ca}·100\%" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="moles\ C\ =\ 12\ g\ C\frac{1\ mol\ C}{12.011\ g\ C}·100\%" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="moles\ O\ =\ 48\ g\ O\frac{1\ mol\ O}{15.999\ g\ O}·100\%" />
<br />

**B.** To obtain the relative numbers of atoms of each element in the compound, divide the number of moles of each element in the 100-g sample by the number of moles of the element in the smallest amount, in this case calcium:

<Math code="Ca:\ \frac{0.9980\ mol\ C}{0.9980\ mol\ C}\ =\ 1.0" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="C:\ \frac{0.9990\ mol\ C}{0.9980\ mol\ Ca}\ =\ 1.001" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="O:\ \frac{3.0011\ mol\ O}{0.9980\ mol\ C}\ =\ 3.007" />
<br />

**C.** We can write the empirical formula of calcium carbonate as Ca<sub>1.000</sub>С<sub>1.001</sub>O<sub>3.007</sub>. The deviation from integral atomic ratios is small and can be attributed to minor experimental errors; therefore, the empirical formula is CaCO<sub>3</sub>.  
**D.** The calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is a cation, carbonate ion (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) is an anion. Hence the formula of the ionic compound is CaCO<sub>3</sub>

**Answer:** CaCO<sub>3</sub>

### 6. Determining the Empirical Formula from Combustion Analysis

:::note Notes:
To determine the empirical formula of a compound from Combustion  
Analysis, we need to take the following steps:

1. Determine the mass of the sample;
2. burn the sample in oxygen;
3. determine the masses of the combustion products;
4. determine the number of moles of each combustion product and then use the atomic masses of elements to calculate the masses of elements other than oxygen in the original sample;
5. find the mass of oxygen by finding the difference between the total mass of the organic compound and the mass of all other elements;
6. use element percentage to calculate moles of C, H, N, S in a 100 g sample;
7. divide the moles of each element by the moles of element present in the smallest amount;
8. multiply by nonintegral ratios as necessary to give small whole numbers.
:::

#### Example

Complete combustion of a 10.5 g sample of organic compound in oxygen yielded 33g of CO<sub>2</sub> and 13.5g of H<sub>2</sub>O. Determine the empirical formula of the organic compound.  
**Given:** mass of sample and mass of combustion products  
**Asked for:** empirical formula

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use the masses and molar masses of the combustion products, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, to calculate the masses of carbon and hydrogen present in the original sample of organic compound.  
**B.** Find the mass of oxygen by finding the difference between the total mass of the organic compound and the mass of carbon and hydrogen.  
**С.** Use those masses and the molar masses of the elements to calculate the empirical formula of the organic compound.

**Solution:**  
**A.** Upon combustion, 1 mol of CO<sub>2</sub> is produced for each mole of carbon atoms in the original sample. Similarly, 1 mol of H<sub>2</sub>O is produced for every 2 mol of hydrogen atoms present in the sample. The masses of carbon and hydrogen in the original sample can be calculated from these ratios, the masses of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, and their molar masses. Because the units of molar mass are grams per mole, we must first convert the masses from milligrams to grams:  
Find the mass of carbon: <Math top='15px' code="\frac{m(CO_2)}{M(CO_2)}:\frac{m(C)}{M(C)}=\frac{33g}{44.010\ g}:\frac{x\ g}{12.011\ g}=9.006g" />

Find the mass of hydrogen: <Math top='15px' code="\frac{m(H_2O)}{M(H_2O)}:\frac{m(H)}{M(H)}=\frac{13.5g}{18.015\ g}:\frac{x\ g}{2.0158\ g}=1.5105g" />

**B.** Find the mass of oxygen: m(O) = m (organic compound) - (m(C)+m(H)) = 10.5- (9.006+1.5105) = 0 (no oxygen)  
**C.** To obtain the relative numbers of atoms of both elements present, we need to calculate the number of moles of each and divide by the number of moles of the element present in the smallest amount:  
Moles C: <Math top='15px' code='n=\frac{m}{M}:\frac{9.006\ g}{12.011\ gmol^{-1}}=\ 0.75\ mol\ C' />

Moles H: <Math top='15px' code='n=\frac{m}{M}:\frac{1.5105\ g}{1.0079\ gmol^{-1}}=\ 1.5\ mol\ H' />

Dividing each number by the number of moles of the element present in the smaller amount gives

<Math top="15px" code="C:\ \frac{0.75}{0.75}=1.00" />
<br />
<Math top="15px" code="H:\ \frac{1.5}{0.75}=2.00" />
<br />
<br />
Thus, the organic compound contains a 1:2 ratio of moles of carbon to moles of hydrogen:
CH<sub>2</sub>. It is an empirical formula of the organic compound. In fact, the
molecular formula of the organic compound is C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, which is
consistent with our results.{' '}

**Answer:** The empirical formula is CH<sub>2</sub>.

### 7. Determining the Molecular Formula from Empirical Formula

Calculate the molecular formula of an unknown compound if its chemical analysis shows that it contains 20% carbon, 53.3% sulfur, and 26.7% oxygen by mass, and its experimentally determined molar mass is 120.008 g/mol.  
**Given:** percent composition and molar mass  
**Asked for:** molecular formula

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Assume 100 g of unknown compound. From the percentages given, calculate the empirical formula of the unknown compound.  
**B.** Calculate the formula mass and then divide the experimentally determined molar mass by the formula mass. This gives the number of formula units present.  
**C.** Multiply each subscript in the empirical formula by the number of formula units to give the molecular formula.

**Solution:**  
**A.** We begin by dividing the mass of each element in 100.0 g of unknown compound (20 g of carbon, 53.3 g of sulfur, 26.7 g of oxygen) by its molar mass. This gives the number of moles of each element in 100 g of unknown compound.

<center>
  <Math code="moles\ C\ =\ 20g\ C\ ·\frac{1mol\ C}{12.011g\ C}=\ 1.665\ mol\ C" />
</center>{' '}

<center>
  <Math code="moles\ S\ =\ 53.3g\ S\ ·\frac{1mol\ S}{32.064g\ C}=\ 1.669\ mol\ S" />
</center>

<center>
  <Math code="moles\ O\ =\ 20g\ O\ ·\frac{1mol\ O}{15.999g\ C}=\ 1.669\ mol\ O" />
</center>
To obtain the relative numbers of atoms of each element present, divide the number
of moles of each element by the number of moles of the element present in the least
amount:
<br />
<Math top="15px" code="C:\ \frac{1.665}{1.665}=\ 1.00" />
<br />
<br />
<Math top="15px" code="S:\ \frac{1.669}{1.669}=\ 1.002" />
<br />
<br />
<Math top="15px" code="O:\ \frac{1.669}{1.669}=\ 1.002" />
<br />
<br />
These results are fairly typical of actual experimental data. None of the atomic
ratios is exactly integral but all are within 5% of integral values. It is
reasonable to assume that such small deviations from integral values are due to
minor experimental errors, so round to the nearest integer. The empirical
formula of the unknown compound is thus CSO.{' '}

**B.** To determine the actual molecular formula, we must divide the experimentally determined molar mass by the formula mass. The formula mass is calculated by dividing the measured molar mass of the unknown compound (60.004 g/mol) by the calculated formula mass.

<Math top="-5px" code="\frac{120.008}{60.004}= 2.00 = 2CSO" />
<br />

**C.** There are two CSO formula units in unknown compound, so the molecular formula must be (CSO)<sub>2</sub>= C<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

**Answer:** C<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>

### 8. Chemical Equations

:::note Notes:
A chemical reaction changes only the distribution of atoms, not the number of atoms.  
**Steps in Balancing a Chemical Equation**

1.  Identify the most complex substance.
2.  Beginning with that substance, choose an element that appears in only one reactant and one product, if possible. Adjust the coefficients to obtain the same number of atoms of this element on both sides.
3.  Balance polyatomic ions (if present) as a unit.
4.  Balance the remaining atoms, usually ending with the least complex substance and using fractional coefficients if necessary. If a fractional coefficient has been used, multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator to obtain whole numbers for the coefficients.
5.  Count the numbers of atoms of each kind on both sides of the equation to be sure that the chemical equation is balanced.  
:::

#### Example 1.

The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of propanol in the laboratory is as follows: C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8(g)</sub>+5O<sub>2(g)</sub> → 3CO<sub>2(g)</sub>+4H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>  
Construct a table showing how to interpret the information in this equation in terms of

1. a single molecule of propanol.
2. moles of reactants and products.
3. grams of reactants and products represented by 1 mol of propanol.
4. numbers of molecules of reactants and products represented by 1 mol of propanol.

**Given:** balanced chemical equation  
**Asked for:** molecule, mole, and mass relationships

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use the coefficients from the balanced chemical equation to determine both the molecular and mole ratios.  
**B.** Use the molar masses of the reactants and products to convert from moles to grams.  
**C.** Use Avogadro’s number to convert from moles to the number of molecules.

**Solution:**  
This equation is balanced as written: each side has 3 carbon atoms, 10 oxygen atoms, and 8 hydrogen atoms. We can therefore use the coefficients directly to obtain the desired information.  
**A.** One molecule of propanol reacts with 5 molecules of O<sub>2</sub> to yield 3 molecules of CO<sub>2</sub> and 4 molecules of H<sub>2</sub>O.  
**B.** One mole of propanol reacts with 5 mol of O<sub>2</sub> to yield 3 mol of CO<sub>2</sub> and 4 mol of H<sub>2</sub>O.  
**C.** To interpret the equation in terms of masses of reactants and products, we need their molar masses and the mole ratios from part b. The molar masses in grams per mole are as follows: propanol, 60.004; O<sub>2</sub>, 31.9988; CO<sub>2</sub>, 44.010; and H<sub>2</sub>O, 18.015.  
One mole of propanol contains Avogadro’s number (6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup>) of propanol molecules.  
Thus 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> propanol molecules react with (5 × 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup>) = 11.6242 × 10<sup>23</sup>oxygen molecules to yield (3 × 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup>) = 18.066 × 10<sup>23</sup> molecules of CO<sub>2</sub> and (4 × 6.022 × 1023) = 24.088 × 10<sup>23</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O.

#### Example 2.

The reaction of the nonane C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub> with oxygen gives carbon dioxide and water. Write and balance the equation for this reaction.  
**Given:** reactants and products  
**Asked for:** balanced chemical equation

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Identify the products and the reactants and then write the unbalanced chemical equation.  
**B.** Follow the steps for balancing a chemical equation.

**Solution:**  
**Identify the most complex substance.**  
We will assume initially that the final balanced chemical equation contains 1 molecule or formula unit of C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>.  
**Adjust the coefficients.** Try to adjust the coefficients of the molecules on the other side of the equation to obtain the same numbers of atoms on both sides. Because one molecule of n-nonane contains 9 carbon atoms, we need 9CO<sub>2</sub> molecules, each of which contains 1 carbon atom, on the right side:  
C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>→9CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O  
**Balance polyatomic ions as a unit.** There are no polyatomic ions to be considered in this reaction.  
**Balance the remaining atoms.** Because one molecule of n-nonane contains 20 hydrogen atoms, we need 10H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, each of which contains 2 hydrogen atoms, on the right side:  
C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>+ O<sub>2</sub>→ 9CO<sub>2</sub>+10H<sub>2</sub>O  
The carbon and hydrogen atoms are now balanced, but we have 28 oxygen atoms on the right side and only 2 oxygen atoms on the left. We can balance the oxygen atoms by adjusting the coefficient in front of the least complex substance, O<sub>2</sub>, on the reactant side:  
C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>+ 14O<sub>2</sub>→ 9CO<sub>2</sub>+10H<sub>2</sub>O  
**Check your work.** The equation is now balanced, and there are no fractional coefficients: there are 9 carbon atoms, 20 hydrogen atoms, and 28 oxygen atoms on each side._Always check to be sure that a chemical equation is balanced._

### 8.1 Converting between Masses of Reactant and Product

:::note Notes:
The method of converting the mass of any reagent or product into the mass of any other reagent or product using a balanced chemical equation contains the general steps:

1.  Convert the mass of one substance (substance A) to the corresponding number of moles using its molar mass.
2.  From the balanced chemical equation, obtain the number of moles of another substance (B) from the number of moles of substance A using the appropriate mole ratio (the ratio of their coefficients).
3.  Convert the number of moles of substance B to mass using its molar mass. It is important to remember that some species are in excess by virtue of the reaction conditions. For example, if a substance reacts with the oxygen in air, then oxygen is in obvious (but unstated) excess.

Converting amounts of substances to moles—and vice versa—is the key to all stoichiometry problems, whether the amounts are given in units of mass (grams or kilograms), weight (pounds or tons), or volume (liters or gallons).  
The molar masses of the reactants and the products are used as conversion factors so that you can calculate the mass of product from the mass of reactant and vice versa.
:::

#### Example

Calculate how much sodium is needed to react with 160 g of oxygen.  
**Given:** reactants, products, and mass of one reactant  
**Asked for:** mass of another reactant

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.  
**B.** Convert mass of oxygen to moles. From the mole ratio in the balanced chemical equation, determine the number of moles of sodium required. Then convert the moles of sodium to the equivalent mass in g.

**Solution:**  
**A.** We first use the information given to write a balanced chemical equation. Because we know the identity of both the reactants and the product, we can write the reaction as follows:

<center>
  Na(s)+O<sub>2</sub>(g) →Na<sub>2</sub>O(s)
</center>
This equation is not balanced because there are two oxygen atoms on the left side
and only one on the right, 1 sodium atom on the left side and 2 sodium atoms on the
right. Assigning a coefficient of 2 to Na<sub>2</sub>O and 4 to Na gives the balanced
chemical equation:
<center>
  4Na(s)+O<sub>2</sub>(g) →2Na<sub>2</sub>O(s)
</center>
Thus 4 mol of Na react with 1 mol of O<sub>2</sub> to produce 2 mol of Na
<sub>2</sub>O.{' '}

**B.** Using the molar mass of O<sub>2</sub> (32.00 g/mol to four significant figures) we can calculate the number of moles of O<sub>2</sub> contained in this mass of O<sub>2</sub>

<center>
  <Math code="n(O_2)\ =\frac{160\ g}{32.00\ gmol^{-1}}=\ 5\ mol\ (O_2)" />
</center>
1. Now use the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation to obtain the number
of moles of Na needed to react with this number of moles of O<sub>2</sub>:<center>
  <Math code="\frac{4\ mol\ of\ Na}{1\ mol\ of\ O_2}=\frac{x\ mol\ of\ Na}{5\ mol\ of\ O_2}" />
</center>
<center>x = 20 mol of Na</center>
2. The molar mass of Na (22.98 g/mol) allows us to calculate the corresponding mass
of Na:
<center>
  <Math code="m(O2)\ = n\ ·\ M\ =\ 20\ mol\ ·\frac{22.98\ g}{mol}=\ 459.6\ g\ (Na)" />
</center>{' '}

**Answer:** 459.6 g of sodium is needed to react with 160 g of oxygen

### 9. Limiting Reactants

:::note Notes:
To determine the mass of the reaction product, if the masses of two reactants are known, we need:

1. Determine the number of moles of each reactant.
2. Compare the mole ratio of the reactants with the ratio in the balanced chemical equation to determine which reactant is limiting.
3. Calculate the number of moles of product that can be obtained from the limiting reactant.
4. Convert the number of moles of product to mass of product.
:::

#### Example

Given 20 g each of ammonia and hydrogen chloride. How many grams of ammonium chloride can be prepared from this reaction?  
**Given:** reactants, products, and mass of reactants  
**Asked for:** mass of product

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Balance the chemical equation for the reaction.  
**B.** Use each molar mass to convert from mass to moles.  
**C.** Using mole ratios, determine which substance is the limiting reactant. After identifying the limiting reactant, use mole ratios based on the number of moles of limiting reactant to determine the number of moles of the product.  
**D.** Convert from moles of product to the mass of the product.

**Solution:**  
We always begin by writing the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:

<center>
  NH<sub>3(g)</sub> + HCl<sub>(g)</sub> = NH<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>(g)</sub>
</center>
We need to calculate the number of moles of ammonia and hydrogen chloride that are
present in 20 g of each.
<center>
  <Math code="n(NH_3)\ =\frac{20.00\ g\ g}{17.00gmol^{-1}}=\ 1.18 mol" />
</center>
<center>
  <Math code="n(NCl)\ = \frac{20.00\ g}{36.453gmol^{-1}}=\ 1.549 mol" />
</center>
C. The number of moles of NH<sub>3</sub> exceeds the number of moles of NCl. Because
the reactants both have coefficients of 1 in the balanced chemical equation, the
mole ratio is 1:1. We have 1.18 mol of NH<sub>3</sub> and 0.549 mol of HCl, so
HCl is the limiting reactant and NH<sub>3</sub> is in excess. The coefficient in
the balanced chemical equation for the product (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) is also 1, so the
mole ratio of HCl and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl is also 1:1. This means that given 0.549 mol
of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, the amount of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl produced must also be 0.549 mol.
D. The final step is to determine the mass of ammonium chloride that can be formed,
which we do by multiplying the number of moles by the molar mass:
<center>
  m(NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) = n ·M = 0.549 mol · 53.453 gmol<sup>-1</sup>=29.346 (g)
</center>
Thus 29.346 g of ammonium chloride can be prepared in this reaction.{' '}

**Answer:** mass of ammonium chloride is 29.346 g

> **Explain a solution strategy using key expressions.**

### 10. Percent Yield

:::note Notes:
The amount of product calculated by the reaction equation represents the theoretical yield, which is the amount you would get if the reaction went perfectly and your product purification method was 100% effective. In fact, you almost always get less product than theoretically possible due to mechanical losses (such as spills), separation procedures that are not 100% effective, competing reactions that form unwanted products, and reactions that just don't pass all the way to completion, resulting in a mixture of products and reagents. Thus, the actual yield, the measured mass of the products resulting from the reaction, is almost always less than the theoretical yield (often much less). The percentage yield of the reaction is the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield multiplied by 100 to get a percentage:

<center>
  <Math code="percend\ yield\ =\frac{actual\ yield\ =\ (g)}{theoretical\ yield\ =\ (g)}·\ 100%" />
</center>
:::

If 160 g of CuO is heated with 2g hydrogen, 48 g of a pure copper is obtained. What is the percent yield?  
Given: masses of reactants and product  
Asked for: percent yield

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Write the balanced chemical equation.  
**B.** Convert from mass of reactants and product to moles using molar masses and then use mole ratios to determine which is the limiting reactant. Based on the number of moles of the limiting reactant, use mole ratios to determine the theoretical yield.  
**C.** Calculate the percent yield by dividing the actual yield by the theoretical yield and multiplying by 100.

**Solution:**  
**A.** From the formulas given for the reactants and the products, we see that the chemical equation is balanced as written. According to the equation, 1 mol of each reactant combines to give 1 mol of product plus 1 mol of water.

<center>
  CuO + H<sub>2</sub> = Cu + H<sub>2</sub>O
</center>{' '}

**B.** To determine which reactant is limiting, we need to know their numbers of mol:

<center>
  <Math
    top="10px"
    code="n(CuO)\ =\frac{160\ g}{79.545\ gmol^{-1}} 2.011\ mol"
  />
</center>{' '}

<center>
  <Math top="15px" code="n(H_2) =\frac{2\ g}{2.014\ gmol^{-1}} 0.993\ mol" />
</center>
The reaction requires a 1:1 mole ratio of the two reactants, so hydrogen is the limiting
reactant. Based on the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation, 1 mol of hydrogen
yields 1 mol of copper. We can therefore obtain only a maximum of 0.993 mol of cupper.
To calculate the corresponding mass of procaine, we use its number of mol multiply
by molar mass:
<center>
  m(Cu) = n ∙ M = 0.993 mol ∙ 63.546 gmol<sup>-1</sup> = 63.104 g (theoretical
  yield)
</center>{' '}

**C.** The actual yield was only 48 g of cupper, so the percent yield was

<center>
  <Math
    top="5px"
    code="percend\ yield\ (Cu)\ =\frac{48\ g}{63.104\ g}∙\ 100%\ =\ 76.065%"
  />
</center>{' '}

**Answer:** The actual yield of copper is 76.065%.

### 11. Atom economy

:::note Notes:
No atoms are gained or lost in a chemical reaction. However, some atoms in the reactants may not end up in the desired product. They instead form other products, and so are regarded as by-products.  
The atom economy of a reaction is a measure of the amount of starting materials that end up as useful products. It is important for sustainable development and for economic reasons to use reactions with high atom economy. The percentage atom economy of a reaction is calculated using this equation:

<center>
  <Math code="atom\ economy\ =\frac{total\ Mr\ of\ the\ desired\ product}{total\ Mr\ of\ all\ reactants}·\ 100%" />
</center>
The ideal atom economy, known as 100% atom economy, for a chemical reaction is taken
as the process where all reactant atoms are found in the desired product.
:::

#### Example

Hydrogen can be manufactured by reacting methane with steam:  
CH<sub>4</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(g) → 3H<sub>2</sub>(g) + CO(g). Using a balanced equation, determine the atom economy for the reaction.  
**Given:** balanced equation  
**Asked for:** atom economy for the reaction relative to hydrogen

**Strategy:**

1. We calculate the molecular mass of all compounds
2. Calculate the atom economy for the reaction

**Solution:**
Mr(CH<sub>4</sub>) = 16;  
Mr(H<sub>2</sub>O) = 18;  
Mr(H<sub>2</sub>) =2;  
total Mr of desired product = 3∙2 = 6;  
Mr(СO) =28

<Math code="atom\ economy\ =\frac{6}{16+18}·\ 100%\ =\ 17.6%" />{' '}

**Answer:** 17.6%

### 12. Ionic Equations

:::note Notes:
The chemical equation for a reaction in solution can be written in three ways. The overall chemical equation shows all the substances present in their undissociated forms; the complete ionic equation shows all the substances present in the form in which they actually exist in solution; and the net ionic equation is derived from the complete ionic equation by omitting all spectator ions, ions that occur on both sides of the equation with the same coefficients. Net ionic equations demonstrate that many different combinations of reactants can give the same net chemical reaction.  
:::

#### Example 1.

Write the overall chemical equation, the complete ionic equation, and the net ionic equation for the reaction of aqueous aluminum chloride with aqueous potassium phosphate to give solid aluminum phosphate and a solution of potassium chloride.  
**Given:** reactants and products  
**Asked for:** overall, complete ionic, and net ionic equations

**Strategy:**

1. Write and balance the overall chemical equation.
2. Write all the soluble reactants and products in their dissociated form to give the complete ionic equation.
3. Then cancel species that appear on both sides of the complete ionic equation to give the net ionic equation.

**Solution:**  
1.From the information given, we can write and balance the overall chemical equation:  
AlCl<sub>3(aq)</sub>+K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4(aq)</sub>→AlPO<sub>4(s)</sub>+3KCl<sub>(aq)</sub>  
This is the overall balanced chemical equation for the reaction, showing the reactants and products in their undissociated form. To obtain the complete ionic equation, we write each soluble reactant and product in dissociated form:  
Al<sup>3+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> +3Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> +3K<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>+PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>→AlPO<sub>4</sub>(s)+3K<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>+3Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>  
The three Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>ions and the three 3K<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>ions that appear on both sides of the equation are spectator ions that can be canceled to give the net ionic equation:  
Al<sup>3+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>+2PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>→ AlPO<sub>4(s)</sub>

#### Example 2.

Write the overall chemical equation, the complete ionic equation, and the net ionic equation for the reaction of aqueous sodium carbonate with aqueous hydrochloric acid to give solid silver phosphate and a solution of sodium fluoride.  
**Given:** reactants and products  
**Asked for:** overall, complete ionic, and net ionic equations

**Strategy:**

1. Write and balance the overall chemical equation.
2. Write all the soluble reactants and products in their dissociated form to give the complete ionic equation.
3. Then cancel species that appear on both sides of the complete ionic equation to give the net ionic equation.

**Solution:**

1. overall chemical equation:

> **Explain a solution strategy using key expressions.**

### 13. Solution Concentrations

:::note Notes:
The most common unit of concentration is molarity, which is also the most useful for calculations involving the stoichiometry of reactions in solution. The molarity (M) of a solution is the number of moles of solute present in exactly 1L of solution. Molarity is also the number of millimoles of solute present in exactly 1 mL of solution:

<center>
  <Math code="molarity\ \frac{moles\ of\ solute}{liters\ of\ solution}=\frac{moles\ of\ solute}{milliliters\ of\ solution}" />
</center>{' '}

<center>
  <Math top="15px" code="C\ =\frac{n}{v}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ " />
  <Math code="n=C\ ∙\ V" />
</center>{' '}

The units of molarity are moles per liter of solution (mol/L), abbreviated as M. In chemical notation, square brackets around the name or formula of the solute represent the concentration of a solute. So

<center>[NaOH]=1.00M[NaOH]=1.00M</center>
<br />
is read as “the concentration of sodium hydroxide is 1.00 molar.” Solutions of
known concentration can be prepared either by dissolving a known mass of solute
in a solvent and diluting to a desired final volume or by diluting the
appropriate volume of a more concentrated solution (a stock solution) to the
desired final volume.
:::

#### Example 1.

Calculate the number of moles of sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) in 3.00 L of 0.150 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.  
**Given:** identity of solute and volume and molarity of solution  
**Asked for:** amount of solute in moles

**Strategy:**  
Use the formula for finding the number of moles  
n = С∙V

**Solution:**  
n(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) = 0.150∙3.00 = 0.45M  
**Answer:** n(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) = 0.45M

#### Example 2.

The solution contains 25.0 g of copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate, CuSO<sub>4</sub>·5H<sub>2</sub>O, in enough ethanol to make exactly 800 mL of solution. What is the molar concentration of CuSO<sub>4</sub>·5H<sub>2</sub>O?  
**Given:** mass of solute and volume of solution  
**Asked for:** concentration (M)

**Strategy:**
To find the number of moles of CuSO<sub>4</sub>·5H<sub>2</sub>O, divide the mass of the compound by its molar mass. Calculate the molarity of the solution by dividing the number of moles of solute by the volume of the solution in liters.

**Solution:**  
The molar mass of CuSO<sub>4</sub>·5H<sub>2</sub>O is 250 g/mol.  
Therefore, moles CuSO4·5H2O = (<Math top='15px' code="\frac{0.25\ mol}{250\ g/mol}" />) = 0.1mol  
The volume of the solution in liters is  
volume=800mL=0.800L volume  
Molarity is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution, so the molarity of the solution is

<center>
  <Math code="C\ =\frac{0.1\ mol}{0.8\ L}=\ 0.125M" />
</center>{' '}

**Answer:** [CuSO4·5H2O] = 0.125M

#### Example 3.

Calculate the mass of acetic acid needed to prepare 500 ml of its 0.2 M solution. Acetic acid has a molar mass of 60 g/mol.  
**Given:** molarity, volume, and molar mass of solute  
**Asked for:** mass of acetic acid

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Calculate the number of moles of acetic acid contained in the indicated volume of dilute solution by multiplying the volume of the solution by its molarity.  
**B.** To determine the mass of acetic acid multiply its number of moles by the molar mass

Solution:  
**A.** We begin by using equation n = C∙V to calculate the number of moles of acetic acid contained in 500 mL of the solution:  
n (acetic acid) = 0.2M∙0.5L=0.1 mol  
**B.** Now we must determine the mass of acetic acid:  
m(acetic acid )=n∙Molar mass  
m(acetic acid )=0.1mol∙60g/mol=6 g  
**Answer:** m(acetic acid )=6 g

#### Example 4.

What volume of a 2.0 M KOH stock solution is necessary to prepare 400 mL 0.1 M KOH?  
**Given:** volume and molarity of dilute solution  
**Asked for:** volume of stock solution

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Calculate the number of moles of potassium hydroxide contained in the indicated volume of dilute solution by multiplying the volume of the solution by its molarity.  
**B.** To determine the volume of stock solution needed, divide the number of moles of potassium hydroxide by the molarity of the stock solution.

**Solution:**
Determine the number of moles of potassium hydroxide in 400 ml of 0.1 M solution:

<center>n(KOH) = 0.1M∙0.4L=0.04 mol </center>{' '}

**B.** We must now determine the volume of the 2.00 M stock solution that contains this amount of potassium hydroxide:

<center>
  <Math code="V\ =\frac{n}{C}" />
</center>
<center>
  <Math code="V\ (stock\ solution)\ \frac{0.04\ mol}{0.2\ M}=\ 0.2\ L" />
</center>

**Answer:** volume of a 2.0 M KOH stock solution is 0.2 L

#### Example 5.

What are the concentrations of all species derived from the solutes in these aqueous solutions?

1. 1.2 M Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
2. 1.5 M Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>
3. 2.5 M CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>  
   **Given:** molarity  
   **Asked for:** concentrations

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Classify each compound as either a strong electrolyte or a nonelectrolyte.  
**B.** If the compound is a nonelectrolyte, its concentration is the same as the molarity of the solution. If the compound is a strong electrolyte, determine the number of each ion contained in one formula unit. Find the concentration of each species by multiplying the number of each ion by the molarity of the solution.

**Solution:**

    Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4(aq)</sub> ↔2Na<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>  
    One formula unit of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> produces two Na<sup>+</sup> ions and one SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> ion, so a 1.2 M Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution contains 2.4 M Na<sup>+</sup> and 1.2 M SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> that is, [Na<sup>+</sup>] 2.4 M and [SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ] = 1.2 M.

### 14. Units for Concentration

:::note Notes:
Different units are used to express the concentrations of a solution depending on the application. The concentration of a solution is the quantity of solute in a given quantity of solution. It can be expressed in several ways: molarity (moles of solute per liter of solution); mole fraction, the ratio of the number of moles of solute to the total number of moles of substances present; mass percentage, the ratio of the mass of the solute to the mass of the solution times 100; parts per thousand (ppt), grams of solute per kilogram of solution; parts per million (ppm), milligrams of solute per kilogram of solution; parts per billion (ppb), micrograms of solute per kilogram of solution; and molality (m), the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.

#### Example

For 120 ml of 20% sulfuric acid solution (density 0.72g / ml) calculate

1. the mass of the solution
2. the mole fraction
3. the molarity
4. the molality

**Given:** volume, percent and density  
**Asked for:** mole fraction, molarity, and molality

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use the density of the solution to calculate the mass of 120 mL solution.  
**B.** Convert grams of solute and solvent to moles of solute and solvent. Calculate the mole fraction of solute by dividing the moles of solute by the total number of moles of substances present in solution.  
**С.** Calculate the molarity of the solution: moles of solute per liter of solution. Determine the molality of the solution by dividing the number of moles of solute by the kilograms of solvent.

**Solution:**  
**А.** m= ρ∙V

<center>
  <Math

    code="m(solution)\ =\ \frac{0.04\ mol}{0.2\ M}\ ·\ 120\ ml\ =\ 86.4\ g"
  />
</center>

**В.** To calculate the mole fraction of sulfuric acid in the solution, we need to know the mass of sulfuric acid and the number moles of both sulfuric acid and water. The mass of sulfuric acid is

<center>
  <Math code="m(sulfuric\ acid)\ =\ \frac{W\ ·\ m\ (solution)}{100%}" />
</center>
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="m(sulfuric\ acid)\ =\ \frac{20%\ ·\ 86.4\ g}{100%}\ =\ 17.28\ g" />
</center>
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="n(sulfuric\ acid)\ =\ \frac{m}{M}" />
</center>
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="n(sulfuric\ acid)\ =\ \frac{17.28\ g}{98\ g/mol}\ =\ 0.176\ mol" />
</center>
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="m(H_2O)=m(solution)-m(solut)" />
</center>
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="m(H_2O)=86.4-17.28=69.12\ g" />
</center>
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="n(H_2O)\ =\frac{69.12\ g}{18\ g/mol} =\ 3.84\ mol" />
</center>
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="the\ mole\ fraction\ =\ \frac{moles\ of\ solute}{total\ moles\ present}\ =\ \frac{0.176}{0.176+3.84}=\ 0,0438" />
</center>

**С.** The molarity of the solution is the number of moles of sulfuric acid per liter of solution. We already know the number of moles of sulfuric acid, so the molarity is

<center>
  <Math
    top="-5px"
    code="С(sulfuric\ acid)\ =\ \frac{0.176\ mol}{0.12\ L}\ =\ 1.47M"
  />
</center>
The molality of the solution is the number of moles of sulfuric acid per kilogram
of solvent. Because we know the number of moles of sulfuric acid in 69.12 g of water,
the calculation is again straight forward:
<center>
  <Math
    top="5px"
    code="molality\ of\ the\ solution\ =\ \frac{0.176\ mol}{0.06912\ kg}\ =\ 2.546 mol/kg"
  />
</center>

**Answer:**

1. mass of the solution = 86.4g
2. mole fraction = 0.0438
3. molarity = 1.47M
4. molality = 2.546 mol/kg

### 15. pH and pOH

:::note Notes:
We can convert between [H<sup>+</sup>] and pH using the following equations:  
pH = -log[H<sup>+</sup>]<br/>
[H <sup>+</sup>] = 10<sup>-pH</sup><br/>
We can convert between [OH<sup>-</sup>] and pOH using the following equations:<br/>
pOH = -log [OH<sup>-</sup>]<br/>
[OH<sup>-</sup>] = 10<sup>-pOH</sup><br/>
For any aqueous solution at 25<sup>∘</sup>C:<br/>
pH + pOH = 14  
For every factor of 10 _INCREASE_ in concentration of [H<sup>+</sup>], pH, will _DECREASE_ by 1 unit, and vice versa. Both acid strength and concentration determine [H<sup>+</sup>] and pH.
:::

#### Example 1. Calculating the pH of a strong base solution

If we use 2 mol of KOH to make of 4.0L an aqueous solution at 25<sup>∘</sup>C, what is the pH of this solution?  
**Given:** amount of substance, volume solution  
**Asked for:** pH of solution

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Calculate the molar concentration of KOH  
**B.** Calculate [OH<sup>-</sup>] based on the dissociation of KOH  
**C.** Calculate pOH from [OH<sup>-</sup>]  
**D.** Calculate pH from pOH using pH + pOH = 14

**Solution:**  
**A.** Molar concentration is equal to moles of solute per liter of solution:

<center>
  <Math top="-5px" code="C\ =\frac{n}{V}" />
</center>
To calculate the molar concentration of KOH we can use the known values for the moles
of KOH and the volume of solution:
<center>
  <Math top="-5px" code="[KOH]\ =\frac{2\ mol}{4\ L} = 0.5M" />
</center>

The concentration of KOH in the solution is _0.5 M_  
**B.** Because KOH is a strong base, it dissociates completely into its constituent ions in aqueous solution: KOH<sub>(ag)</sub>↔K<sup>+</sup><sub>(ag)</sub> + OH<sup>-</sup><sub>(ag)</sub>  
This balanced equation tells us that every mole of KOH produces one mole of OH<sup>-</sup> in aqueous solution. Therefore, we have the following relationship between [KOH] and [OH<sup>-</sup>]:  
[KOH] =[OH<sup>-</sup>]=_0.5M_  
**C.** Now that we know the concentration of [OH<sup>-</sup>], we can calculate pOH using pOH = -log [OH<sup>-</sup>] = - log (0.5) = 0.3  
**D.** We can calculate pH from pOH using pH + pOH = 14  
We can substitute the value of pOH we found in «С» to find the pH:  
pH = 14 – pOH  
pH = 14 –0.3 = 13.7

#### Example 2. Calculating the pH of a weak acid solution

Calculate the pH of 0.200 moldm<sup>-3</sup> ethanoic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH. (K<sub>a</sub> = 1.74 × 10<sup>-5</sup>mol dm<sup>-3</sup>)  
**Step 1** Write the equilibrium expression for the reaction.

</center>
<br />
<center>
  <Math top="-5px" code="K_a=\frac{[H^+]^2}{[CH_3COOH]}" />
</center>

**Step 2** Enter the values into the expression.

<center>
  <Math top="-5px" code="1.74\ ·\ 10^5\ =\frac{[H^+]^2}{(0,2)}" />
</center>

**Step 3** Rearrange the equation.

<center>
  <Math top="-5px" code="[H^+]^2\ = 1.74 · 10^{-5} · 0.2 = 0.348 · 10^{-5}" />

### 16. Calculating the pH of a Buffer

:::note Notes:
Buffers are solutions that resist a change in pH after adding an acid or a base. Buffers contain a weak acid (HA) and its conjugate weak base (A−). Adding a strong electrolyte that contains one ion in common with a reaction system that is at equilibrium shifts the equilibrium in such a way as to reduce the concentration of the common ion. The shift in equilibrium is called the common ion effect. Buffers are characterized by their pH range and buffer capacity. The useful pH range of a buffer depends strongly on the chemical properties of the conjugate weak acid–base pair used to prepare the buffer (the Ka or Kb), whereas its buffer capacity depends solely on the concentrations of the species in the solution. The pH of a buffer can be calculated from the concentrations of the weak acid and the weak base used to prepare it, the concentration of the conjugate base and conjugate acid, and the pK<sub>a</sub> or pK<sub>b</sub> of the weak acid or weak base.  
An alternative method frequently used to calculate the pH of a buffer solution is based on a rearrangement of the equilibrium equation for the dissociation of a weak acid. The simplified ionization reaction is HA⇌H<sup>+</sup> +A<sup>−</sup> for which the equilibrium constant expression is as follows:

<center>
  <Math top="-5px" code="K_a\ =\ \frac{[H^+][A^–]}{[HA]}" />
</center>
<center>
  <Math top="15px" code="[H^+]\ =\ K_a\frac{[A^–]}{[HA]}" /> or pH ={' '}
  <Math top="15px" code="pH\ =\ pK_a\ +\ log\frac{[A^–]}{[HA]}" /> or, more
  generally, <Math top="15px" code="pH\ =\ pK_a\ +\ log\frac{[base]}{[acid]}" />
</center>
<br />

If [base] = [acid] for a buffer, then pH = pKa. Changing this ratio by a factor of 10 either way changes the pH by ±1 unit.  
Because no single buffer system can effectively maintain a constant pH value over the physiological range of approximately 5 to 7.4, biochemical systems use a set of buffers with overlapping ranges. The most important of these is the CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> system, which dominates the buffering action of blood plasma.
:::

#### Example 1.

What is the pH of a solution that contains 0.03M NH<sub>3</sub> and 0.04M. (pK<sub>b</sub> = 4.76)  
**Given:** concentration of base, conjugate acid, and pKb  
**Asked for:** pH

**Strategy:**  
Substitute values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation <Math top='15px' code="pH\ =\ pK_a\ +\ log\frac{[base]}{[acid]}" /> to calculate the pH.

**Solution:**  
Inserting the given values into the equation <Math top='15px' code="pH\ =\ pK_a\ +\ log\frac{[base]}{[acid]}" />. Thus pK<sub>a</sub> for the ammonium ion is <Math top='3px' code="pK_w − pK_b\ =\ 14.00\ –\ 4.76\ =\ 9.24" />. Substituting this pK<sub>a</sub> value into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation,

<center>
  <Math top="15px" code="pH\ =\ 9.24\ +\ log\frac{[0.03]}{[0.04]}\ =\ 9.11" />
</center>

**Answer:** pH=9.11

#### Example 2.

The buffer solution contained 0.135 M HCO<sub>2</sub>H and 0.215 M HCO<sub>2</sub>Na and had a pH of 3.95.

1. What is the final pH if 5.00 mL of 1.00 M HCl are added to 100 mL of this solution?
2. What is the final pH if 5.00 mL of 1.00 M NaOH are added?

**Given:** composition and pH of buffer; concentration and volume of added acid or base  
**Asked for:** final pH

**Strategy:**  
**1.**  
**A.** Calculate the amounts of formic acid and formate present in the buffer solution. Then calculate the amount of acid or base added.  
**B.** Construct a table showing the amounts of all species after the neutralization reaction. Use the final volume of the solution to calculate the concentrations of all species. Finally, substitute the appropriate values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to obtain the pH.

**Solution:**
The added HCl (a strong acid) or NaOH (a strong base) will react completely with formate (a weak base) or formic acid (a weak acid), respectively, to give formic acid or formate and water. We must therefore calculate the amounts of formic acid and formate present after the neutralization reaction.  
**A.** We begin by calculating the millimoles of formic acid and formate present in 100 mL of the initial pH 3.95 buffer:

<center>
  <Math code="n(HCO_2H)\ =log\frac{0.135}{100}=\ 13.5\ mmol" />
</center>
<center>
  <Math code="n(HCO_2^-)\ =log\frac{0.215}{100}=\ 21.5\ mmol" />
</center>

The millimoles of H<sup>+</sup> in 5.00 mL of 1.00 M HCl is as follows:

<center>
  <Math code="n(H^+)\ =\ 5\ mL\ ·\ 1M\ =\ 5mmol" />
</center>

**B.** Next, we construct a table of initial amounts, changes in amounts, and final amounts:

<Math code="HCO_2^-(aq)+H^+(aq)→HCO_2H(aq)" />
<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan='4'>
      <center><Math code="HCO_2^−(aq) + H^+(aq) → HCO_2H(aq)" /></center>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>[HCO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>]</td>
    <td>[H<sup>+</sup>]</td>
    <td>[HCO<sub>2</sub>H]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>initial</td>
    <td>21.5 mmol</td>
    <td>5.00 mmol</td>
    <td>13.5 mmol</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>change</td>
    <td>−5.00 mmol</td>
    <td>−5.00 mmol</td>
    <td>+5.00 mmol</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>final</td>
    <td>16.5 mmol</td>
    <td>∼0 mmol</td>
    <td>18.5 mmol</td>
  </tr>
</table>
The final amount of H<sup>+</sup> in solution is given as “∼0 mmol.” For the purposes of the stoichiometry calculation, this is essentially true, but remember that the point of the problem is to calculate the final [H+] and thus the pH. We now have all the information we need to calculate the pH. We can use either the lengthy procedure of Example 14 or the Henderson–Hasselbach equation. Because we have performed many equilibrium calculations in this chapter, we’ll take the latter approach. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation requires the concentrations of HCO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and HCO<sub>2</sub>H, which can be calculatedusing the number of millimoles (n) of each and the total volume (V<sub>T</sub>). Substituting these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation,  
<center><Math code="pH\ =\ pK_a\ +\ log\frac{[base]}{[acid]}=\ K_a\ +\ log\frac{[HCO_2^–]}{[HCO_2H]}" /></center>

Because the total volume appears in both the numerator and denominator, it cancels. We therefore need to use only the ratio of the number of millimoles of the conjugate base to the number of millimoles of the weak acid. So  
<center><Math code="pH\ =\ pK_a\ +\ log\frac{[base]}{[acid]}=\ K_a\ +\ log\frac{[HCO_2^–]}{[HCO_2H]}=\ 3.75\ +\ log\frac{[16.5]}{[18.5]}=\ 3.75\ –\ 0.050\ =\ 3.7" /></center>  

**2.**  
The number of millimoles of OH− in 5.00 mL of 1.00 M NaOH is as follows:  
<center><Math code="n(OH^-)\ =\ 5\ mL\ ·\ 1M\ =\ 5mmol" /></center>  

With this information, we can construct a table of initial amounts, changes in amounts, and final amounts.  
<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan='4'>
      <center><Math code="HCO_2H(aq) + OH^−(aq) → HCO_2^−(aq) + H_2O(l)" /></center>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>[HCO<sub>2</sub>H]</td>
    <td>[OH<sup>-</sup>]</td>
    <td>[HCO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>initial</td>
    <td>13.5 mmol</td>
    <td>5.00 mmol</td>
    <td>21.5 mmol</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>change</td>
    <td>−5.00 mmol</td>
    <td>−5.00 mmol</td>
    <td>+5.00 mmol</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>final</td>
    <td>8.5 mmol</td>
    <td>∼0 mmol</td>
    <td>26.5 mmol</td>
  </tr>
</table>  
The final amount of OH<sup>−</sup>− in solution is not actually zero; this is only approximately true based on the stoichiometric calculation. We can calculate the final pH by inserting the numbers of millimoles of both HCO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and HCO<sub>2</sub>H into the simplified Henderson-Hasselbalch expression  
<center><Math code="pH\ =\ pK_a\ +\ log\frac{[base]}{[acid]}=\ K_a\ +\ log\frac{[HCO_2^–]}{[HCO_2H]}=\ 3.75\ +\ log\frac{[26.5]}{[8.5]}=\ 3.75\ –\ 0.494\ =\ 4.24" /></center>

### 17. Applying the Ideal Gas Law  

:::note Notes:
The empirical relationships among the volume, the temperature, the pressure, and the amount of a gas can be combined into the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. The proportionality constant, R, is called the gas constant and has the value 0.08206 <Math top='10px' code='\frac{L·atm}{K·mol}' /> , 8.3145 <Math top='10px' code='\frac{J}{K·mol}' /> or 1.9872 <Math top='10px' code='\frac{cal}{K·mol}' /> , depending on the units used. The ideal gas law describes the behavior of an ideal gas, a hypothetical substance whose behavior can be explained quantitatively by the ideal gas law and the kinetic molecular theory of gases. Standard temperature and pressure (STP) is 0°C and 1 atm. The volume of 1 mol of an ideal gas at STP is 22.41 L, the standard molar volume. All of the empirical gas relationships are special cases of the ideal gas law in which two of the four parameters are held constant. The ideal gas law allows us to calculate the value of the fourth quantity (P, V, T, or n) needed to describe a gaseous sample when the others are known and also predict the value of these quantities following a change in conditions if the original conditions (values of P, V, T, and n) are known. The ideal gas law can also be used to calculate the density of a gas if its molar mass is known or, conversely, the molar mass of an unknown gas sample if its density is measured.  
<center><Math top='10px' code='PV\ =\ nRT;\ PV\ =\frac{m}{M}RT;\ \frac{m}{MV}=\ PRT;\ d\ =\frac{m}{V}=\frac{MP}{RT}' /></center>

#### Example 1.

How many moles of oxygen gas were needed to fill the balloon if its volume was 400L, the temperature at 25°C and the atmospheric pressure was 750 mmHg?  
**Given:** volume, temperature, and pressure  
**Asked for:** amount of gas  

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Solve the ideal gas law for the unknown quantity, in this case n.  
**B.** Make sure that all quantities are given in units that are compatible with the units of the gas constant. If necessary, convert them to the appropriate units, insert them into the equation you have derived, and then calculate the number of moles of hydrogen gas needed.  

**Solution:**  
**A.** We are given values for P, T, and V and asked to calculate n. If we solve the ideal gas law for n, we obtain: n=PVRT  
**B.** P and T are given in units that are not compatible with the units of the gas constant [0.08206 <Math top='10px' code='\frac{L·atm}{K·mol}' />]. We must therefore convert the temperature to kelvins and the pressure to atmospheres:  
<center><Math code='\frac{1\ atm}{x\ atm}=\frac{760\ mm\ H\ g}{750\ mm\ H\ g}' /></center>
<center><Math code='x\ =\ 0.9868\ atm' /></center>
<center><Math code='T=273+25=298' /></center>

Substituting these values into the expression we derived for n, we obtain<br/>n=PVRT=0.9868atm ∙ 400L ∙ 0.08206 <Math top='10px' code='\frac{L·atm}{K·mol}' /> 298K = 9652.85 mol = 9.653 ∙ 10<sup>3</sup> mol  

**Answer:** 9.653∙10<sup>3</sup> mol  

#### Example 2.

**Given:** pressure, temperature, mass, and volume  
**Asked for:** molar mass and chemical formula  

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Solve Equation <Math top='10px' code='\frac{m}{MV}' />=PRT for the molar mass of the gas and then calculate the density of the gas from the information given.  
**B.** Convert all known quantities to the appropriate units for the gas constant being used. Substitute the known values into your equation and solve for the molar mass.  
**C.** Propose a reasonable empirical formula using the atomic masses of nitrogen and oxygen and the calculated molar mass of the gas.  

**Solution:**  
**A.** Density is the mass of the gas divided by its volume:  
<Math top='-5px' code='d\ =\frac{m}{V}=\frac{0.289\ g}{0.157L}=\ 1.84\frac{g}{L}' />

**B.** We must convert the other quantities to the appropriate units before inserting them into the equation:  
<center><Math code='T=18+273=291K' /></center><br/>
<center><Math code='\frac{1\ atm}{x\ atm}=\frac{760\ mm\ H}{727\ mm\ H\ g}' /></center><br/>
<center><Math top='-15px' code='x\ =\ 0.957\ atm' /></center>  
The molar mass of the unknown gas is thus <Math top='15px' code='M=\frac{mRT}{pV}=\frac{dRT}{p}' />

<Math code='M=\frac{1.84\ \frac{g}{L}0.08206\ \frac{L\ ·\ atm}{K\ ·\ mol}\ 291K}{0.957\ atm}=\ 45.9\ \frac{g}{mol}' />  

**C.** The atomic masses of N and O are approximately 14 and 16, respectively, so we can construct a list showing the masses of possible combinations:  
<Math code='M(NO)\ =\ 14+16=30\frac{g}{mol}' /><br/>
<Math code='M(N_2O)\ =\ 2∙14+16=44\frac{g}{mol}' /><br/>
<Math code='M(NO_2)\ =\ 14+2∙16\frac{g}{mol}' />

The most likely choice is NO<sub>2</sub> which agrees with the data. The red-brown color of smog also results from the presence of NO<sub>2</sub> gas.

### 18. Stoichiometry Involving Gases

:::note Notes:
The relationship between the amounts of products and reactants in a chemical reaction can be expressed in units of moles or masses of pure substances, of volumes of solutions, or of volumes of gaseous substances. The ideal gas law can be used to calculate the volume of gaseous products or reactants as needed.  
The ideal gas equation and the stoichiometry of a reaction can be used to calculate the volume of gas produced or consumed in a reaction.

#### Example

What volume of NO<sub>2</sub> (in liters) at 18°C and 755 mmHg pressure is required to produce 3.00 tons of HNO<sub>3</sub> according to the equation: 4NO<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O = 4HNO<sub>3</sub>?  
**Given:** reaction, temperature, pressure, and mass of one product  
**Asked for:** volume of gaseous reactant

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Calculate the number of moles of HNO<sub>3</sub> in 3.00 tons. From the stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation, calculate the number of moles of NO<sub>2</sub> required.  
**B.** Use the ideal gas law to determine the volume of NO<sub>2</sub> required under the given conditions. Be sure that all quantities are expressed in the appropriate units.  

**Solution:**  
We can see from the stoichiometry of the reaction that 4 mol of NO<sub>2</sub> is required to produce 4 mol of HNO<sub>3</sub>.  
**A.** We begin by calculating the number of moles of HNO<sub>3</sub> in 3.00Tn:  

<Math code='n(HNO_3)\ =\frac{m}{M}=\frac{3∙10^6g}{63\frac{g}{mol}}\ =\ 4.762\ ∙\ 10^4mol' />

We next calculate the number of moles of NO<sub>2</sub> required:  
<Math code='n(HNO_3)\ =n(NO_2)=\ 4.762\ ∙\ 10^4mol' />  

We must convert the temperature to kelvins and the pressure to atmospheres:  
<center><Math code='\frac{1\ atm}{x\ atm}=\frac{760\ mm\ H\ g}{755\ mm\ H\ g}' /></center><br/>
<center><Math code='x\ =\ 0.9934\ atm' /></center><br />
<center><Math code='T\ =\ 273+18\ =\ 291K' /></center>

**B.** After converting all quantities to the appropriate units, we can use the ideal gas law to calculate the volume of NO<sub>2</sub>:  
<center><Math code='V\ =\frac{nRT}{P}' /></center><br />
<center><Math code='V(NO^2)\ =\frac{4.762·\ 10^4\ mol\ ·\ 0.08206\frac{L\ ·\ atm}{K\ ·\ mol}291K}{0.9934\ atm}' /></center><br />
<center><Math code='V(NO^2)\ =\ 114.47\ ·\ 10^4L' /></center>

**Answer:** The answer means that 114.47∙10<sup>4</sup>L of nitrogen dioxide gas are needed to produce    
3 Tn of Nitric acid.

### 19. Calorimetry

:::note Notes:
Calorimetry is the set of techniques used to measure enthalpy changes during chemical processes. It uses devices called calorimeters, which measure the change in temperature when a chemical reaction is carried out.  
The magnitude of the temperature change depends on the amount of heat released or absorbed and on the heat capacity of the system.  
The heat capacity (C) of an object is the amount of energy needed to raise its temperature by 1°C; its units are joules per degree Celsius.  
The specific heat (Cs) of a substance is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 g of the substance by 1°C, and the molar heat capacity (Cp) is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 mol of a substance by 1°C.  
Liquid water has one of the highest specific heats known. Heat flow measurements can be made with either a constant-pressure calorimeter, which gives ΔH values directly, or a bomb calorimeter, which operates at constant volume and is particularly useful for measuring enthalpies of combustion.  
<center>q=nC<sub>p</sub>ΔT, C<sub>p</sub> - the molar heat capacity</center>  
<center>q=mC<sub>s</sub>ΔT,  C<sub>s</sub> - the specific heat</center>   
<center>ΔH<sub>rxn</sub>=q<sub>rxn</sub>= − q<sub>calorimater</sub> = − mC<sub>s</sub>ΔT</center>
:::

#### Example 
When 6.2 g of solid sodium hydroxide is dissolved in 200.0 mL of distilled water in a calorimeter, the temperature of the liquid increases from 21.0°C to 28.4°C. The density of water in this temperature range averages 0.9978<Math code='\frac{g}{cm^3}' />. What is ΔH<sub>soln</sub> (in kilojoules per mole)? Assume that the calorimeter absorbs a negligible amount of heat and, because of the large volume of water, the specific heat of the solution is the same as the specific heat of pure water.  
**Given:** mass of substance, volume of solvent, and initial and final temperatures  
**Asked for:** ΔH<sub>soln</sub>  

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Calculate the mass of the solution from its volume and density and calculate the temperature change of the solution.  
**B.** Find the heat flow that accompanies the dissolution reaction by substituting the appropriate values into <Math code='ΔH_{rxn}=q_{rxn}= −q_{calorimater} = −mC_sΔT' />  
**C.** Use the molar mass of NaOH to calculate ΔH<sub>sol</sub>n.

**Solution:**  
**A.** To calculate ΔH<sub>soln</sub>, we must first determine the amount of heat released in the calorimetry experiment. The mass of the solution is  
<Math code='(200.0mLH_2O)∙(0.9978\frac{g}{cm^3})+6.2g\ NaOH=205.8g' /> 

the temperature change is (28.4°C − 21.0°C) = +7.4°C.  
**B.** Because the solution is not very concentrated (approximately 0.775 M), we assume that the specific heat of the solution is the same as that of water. The heat flow that accompanies dissolution is thus  
<Math code='q_{calorimater}= mC_sΔT = 205.8g\frac{1.84 J}{g^oC}7.4^oC=7371J=7.371 kJ' /> 

The temperature of the solution increased because heat was absorbed by the solution (q > 0). Where did this heat come from? It was released by NaOH dissolving in water. From <br/>Equation we see that ΔH<sub>rxn</sub> = −q<sub>calorimeter</sub> = −7.371 k  
This experiment tells us that dissolving 6.2 g of NaOH in water is accompanied by the release of 7.371 kJ of energy. Because the temperature of the solution increased, the dissolution of NaOH in water must be exothermic.  
**C.** The last step is to use the molar mass of NaOH to calculate ΔH<sub>soln</sub>—the heat released when dissolving 1 mol of NaOH:  
<center><Math code='ΔH_{soln}=\frac{6.2\ g}{7.371\ kJ}=\frac{40\ g}{x\ kJ}' /></center>  
<center><Math code='x\ =\ 47.55\ kJ' /></center>  

**Answer:** 47.55 kJ

### 20. Hess's Law  

:::note Notes:
Hess's law: The overall enthalpy change for a series of reactions is the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual reactions.  
When using Hess’s law to calculate the value of ΔH for a reaction, follow this procedure:  
1) Identify the equation whose ΔH value is unknown and write individual reactions with known ΔH values that, when added together, will give the desired equation.  
2) Arrange the chemical equations so that the reaction of interest is the sum of the individual reactions.  
3) If a reaction must be reversed, change the sign of ΔH for that reaction. Additionally, if a reaction must be multiplied by a factor to obtain the correct number of moles of a substance, multiply its ΔH value by that same factor.  
4) Add together the individual reactions and their corresponding ΔH values to obtain the reaction of interest and the unknown ΔH.  
:::

#### Example 

When carbon is burned with limited amounts of oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) is the main product:  
(1) 2C<sub>(s)</sub>+O<sub>2(g)</sub>→2CO<sub>(g)</sub> ΔH=−221.0kJ  
When carbon is burned in excess O<sub>2</sub>, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is produced:  
(2) C<sub>(s)</sub>+O<sub>2(g)</sub>→CO<sub>2(g)</sub> ΔH=−393.5kJ  
Use this information to calculate the enthalpy change per mole of CO for the reaction of CO with O<sub>2</sub> to give CO<sub>2</sub>.  
**Given:** two balanced chemical equations and their ΔH values  
**Asked for:** enthalpy change for a third reaction

**Strategy:**  
**A.** After balancing the chemical equation for the overall reaction, write two equations whose ΔH values are known and that, when added together, give the equation for the overall reaction. (Reverse the direction of one or more of the equations as necessary, making sure to also reverse the sign of ΔH.)  
**B.** Multiply the equations by appropriate factors to ensure that they give the desired overall chemical equation when added together. To obtain the enthalpy change per mole of CO, write the resulting equations as a sum, along with the enthalpy change for each.  

**Solution:**  
**A.** We begin by writing the balanced chemical equation for the reaction of interest:  
(3) CO<sub>(g)</sub>+0.5O<sub>2(g)</sub>→CO<sub>2(g)</sub> ΔH<sub>rxn</sub>=?  
There are at least two ways to solve this problem using Hess’s law and the data provided. The simplest is to write two equations that can be added together to give the desired equation and for which the enthalpy changes are known. Observing that CO, a reactant in Equation 3, is a product in Equation 1, we can reverse Equation (1) to give  
2CO<sub>(g)</sub> →2C<sub>(s)</sub>+O<sub>2(g)</sub> ΔH=+221.0kJ  
Because we have reversed the direction of the reaction, the sign of ΔH is changed. We can use Equation 2 as written because its product, CO<sub>2</sub>, is the product we want in Equation 3:  
C<sub>(s)</sub> + O<sub>2(g)</sub> →CO<sub>2(s)</sub> ΔH=−393.5kJ  
**B.** Adding these two equations together does not give the desired reaction, however, because the numbers of C(s) on the left and right sides do not cancel. According to our strategy, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to obtain 2 mol of C(s) as the reactant:  
C<sub>(s)</sub> +2O<sub>2(g)</sub>→2CO<sub>2(s)</sub> ΔH=−787.0kJ  
Writing the resulting equations as a sum, along with the enthalpy change for each, gives  
<img src={cal}/>
Note that the overall chemical equation and the enthalpy change for the reaction are both for the reaction of 2 mol of CO with O<sub>2</sub>, and the problem asks for the amount per mole of CO. Consequently, we must divide both sides of the final equation and the magnitude of ΔH by 2:  
<center><Math code='CO_{(g)}\ +0.5O_{2(g)}→CO_{2(g)}\ =\ ΔH=\ −283.0kJ' /></center>  

**Answer:** *-283.0kJ*
