### 1. The molecular mass of a substance

:::note Notes:
The molecular mass of a substance is the sum of the average masses of the atoms in one molecule of a substance. It is calculated by adding together the atomic masses of the elements in the substance, each multiplied by its subscript (written or implied) in the molecular formula. Because the units of atomic mass are atomic mass units, the units of molecular mass are also atomic mass units. The procedure for calculating molecular masses is illustrated in Example 1.
:::

#### Example

Calculate the molecular mass of propanol, whose condensed structural formula is  
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH  
**Given:** molecule  
**Asked for:** molecular mass

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Determine the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.  
**B.** Obtain the atomic masses of each element from the periodic table and multiply the atomic mass of each element by the number of atoms of that element.  
**C.** Add together the masses to give the molecular mass.

**Solution:**  
**A.** The molecular formula of propanol may be written in three different ways: CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub>OH (which illustrates the presence of a propyl group, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>−, and an −OH group), C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>OH, and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O; all show that propanol has three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom.  
**B.** Taking the atomic masses from the periodic table, we obtain:  
3×atomic; mass of carbon=3 atoms · (12.011amu/atom) =36.033amu  
8×atomic; mass of hydrogen=8 atoms · (1.0079amu/atom) =8.0632amu  
1×atomic; mass of oxygen=1atoms · (15.9994amu/atom) =15.9994amu  
**C.** Adding together the masses gives the molecular mass:  
36.033amu + 8.0632amu + 15.9994amu = 60.0956amu  
**Alternatively,** we could have used unit conversions to reach the result in one step:Mr(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O) = [3 atoms · (12.011amu/1atom C)] + [8 atoms H · (1.0079amu/1atom H)] + [1atoms O · (15.9994amu/1atom O)]

**Answer:**  
the molecular mass of propanol is 60.0956amu or Mr(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O) =60.0956amu

### 2. Molar Mass

:::note Notes:
The molar mass is defined as the mass in grams of 1 mol of that substance. One mole of isotopically pure carbon-12 has a mass of 12 g. For an element, the molar mass is the mass of 1 mol of atoms of that element; for a covalent molecular compound, it is the mass of 1 mol of molecules of that compound; for an ionic compound, it is the mass of 1 mol of formula units. That is, the molar mass of a substance is the mass (in grams per mole) of 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> atoms, molecules, or formula units of that substance. In each case, the number of grams in 1 mol is the same as the number of atomic mass units that describe the atomic mass, the molecular mass, or the formula mass, respectively. The molar mass of any substance is its atomic mass, molecular mass, or formula mass in grams per mole. The periodic table lists the atomic mass of carbon as 12.011 amu; the average molar mass of carbon—the mass of 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> carbon atoms—is therefore 12.011 g/mol

#### Example 1.

Calculate the number of moles and molecules of oxygen in 4g oxygen molecules with the formula O<sub>2</sub>  
**Given:** mass and molecular formula  
**Asked for:** number of moles and number of molecules

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use the molecular formula of the compound to calculate its molecular mass in grams per mole.  
**B.** Convert from mass to moles by dividing the mass given by the compound’s molar mass.  
**C.** Convert from moles to molecules by multiplying the number of moles by Avogadro’s number.

**Solution:**  
**A.** The molecular mass of oxygen can be calculated from its molecular formula using the method:  
Mr(O<sub>2</sub>) = (2 atoms of O) · (15.9994amu/atom O) = 31.9988amu  
The molar mass of oxygen is 31.9988 g/mol  
**B.** The number of moles of oxygen present in 4g can be calculated by dividing the mass (in grams) by the molar mass (in grams per mole):

<center>
  <Math code="n=\frac{m}{M}" />
</center>
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="n(O2)=\frac{4g}{31.9988\ gmol^-1}= 0.125\ mol" />
</center>{' '}

**C.** To calculate the number of molecules in the sample, we multiply the number of moles by Avogadro’s number:

<center>
  N (number of molecules) = N<sub>a</sub>· n
</center>
<center>
  N(O<sub>2</sub>) = 6,02 · 1023 mol<sup>-1</sup> · 0.125 mol = 0.7525 · 10
  <sup>23</sup> molecules
</center>{' '}

**Answer:**  
n(O<sub>2</sub>) = 0.125 mol; N(O<sub>2</sub>) = 0.7525 × 10<sup>23</sup> molecules

#### Example 2.

Calculate the mass of 1.75 mol of each compound:

1. SO<sub>2</sub> (sulfur dioxide)
2. Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (sodium carbonate)  
   **Given:** number of moles and molecular or empirical formula  
   **Asked for:** mass

**Strategy:**
**A.** Calculate the molecular mass of the compound in grams from its molecular formula (if covalent) or empirical formula (if ionic).  
**B.** Convert from moles to mass by multiplying the moles of the compound given by its molar mass.

**Solution:**  
We begin by calculating the molecular mass of SO2 and the formula mass of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.  
**A.** The molar mass of SO2 is obtained from its molecular mass as follows:  
Mr(SO<sub>2</sub>) = (1 atom of S) · (32.065amu/atom S) + (2 atoms of O) · (15.9994amu/atom O) =32.065amu + 31.9988amu = 64.0638amu  
The molar mass of SO<sub>2</sub> is 64.0638 g/mol.  
The mass of 1.75 mol of SO2 is calculated as follows:  
m(SO<sub>2</sub>) = n · M  
m(SO<sub>2</sub>) = 1.75 · 64.0638 gmol<sup>-1</sup> = 112.1165g  
**B.** The formula mass of Na2CO3 is obtained as follows:  
The formula mass [Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>] = [(2 atoms of Na) · (22.98977amu/atom Na) + (1 atom of C) · (12.011amu/atom C)+ (3 atoms of O) · (15.9994amu/atom C)] = 45.97954amu +12.011amu +47.9982amu =105.98874amu  
The molar mass of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is 105.98874 g/mol.  
The mass of 1.75 mol of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is calculated as follows:  
m(Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) = n · M  
m(Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) = 1.75 · 105.98874gmol<sup>-1</sup> = 185.48029g

**Answer:**
m(SO<sub>2</sub>) = 112.1165g; m(Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) = 185.48029g

### 4. Calculating Mass Percentages

:::note Notes:
Mass percentage is calculated as the mass of a component divided by the total mass of the mixture, multiplied by 100%<br/>

<center>
  <Math code="\%\ by\ mass =\frac{mass(component)}{mass(mixture)}·100\%" />
</center>
<br />
The percent composition AxBy of a compound can also be determined from the
formula of the compound. The subscripts in the formula are first used to
calculate the mass of each element in one mole of the compound. That is divided
by the molar mass of the compound and multiplied by 100%
<br />
<center>
  <Math code="\%\ by\ mass\ (A) =\frac{m(A\ in\ 1\ mol\ of\ the\ compound)}{molar\ mass(A_xB_y)}·100\%" />
</center>
<br />
:::

#### Example

Glycine is the simplest amino acid that reduces psycho-emotional stress and increases mental productivity. Its molecular formula is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. Calculate the mass percentage of each element in glycine. Calculate the mass of carbon in a 1.00 g packet of Equal, assuming it is pure glycine.  
**Given:** molecular formula and mass of sample  
**Asked for:** mass percentage of all elements and mass of one element in sample

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use atomic masses from the periodic table to calculate the molar mass of glycine.  
**B.** Divide the mass of each element by the molar mass of glycine then multiply by 100 to obtain percentages.  
**C.** To find the mass of an element contained in a given mass of glycine, multiply the mass of glycine by the mass percentage of that element, expressed as a decimal.

**Solution:**  
**A.** We calculate the mass of each element in 1 mol of glycine and the molar mass of glycine, here to three decimal places:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>2 C</td>
    <td>(2 mol C)(12.011 g/mol C) =</td>
    <td>24.022 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5 H</td>
    <td>(5 mol H)(1.008 g/mol H) =</td>
    <td>5.04 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1N</td>
    <td>(1 mol N)(14.007 g/mol N) =</td>
    <td>14.007 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2O</td>
    <td>(2 mol O)(15.999 g/mol O) =</td>
    <td>31.998 g</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>
    </td>
    <td>molar mass of aspartame</td>
    <td>75.067 g/mol</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**B.** To calculate the mass percentage of each element, we divide the mass of each element in the compound by the molar mass of glycine and then multiply by 100 to obtain percentages, here reported to two decimal places:

<Math code="m\ \%\ C\ =\frac{24.022\ g\ C}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 32\%\ C" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="m\ \%\ H\ =\frac{5.04\ g\ H}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 6.714\%\ H" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="m\ \%\ N\ =\frac{14.007\ g\ N}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 18.659\%\ N" />
<br />
<br />
<Math code="m\ \%\ O\ =\frac{31.998 \ g\ O}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 42.627\%\ O" />
<br />
As a check, we can add the percentages together: 32% + 6.714% + 18.659% + 42.627%
= 100.00% If you obtain a total that differs from 100% by more than about ±1%, there
must be an error somewhere in the calculation.{' '}

**C.** The mass of carbon in 1.00 g of glycine is calculated as follows:

<Math code="m\ of\ C\ =1\ g\ glicine\ ·\frac{24.022\ g\ C}{75.067\ g\ glicine}·100\% = 0.2934\ g\ C" />
<br />
Answer: m % C = 32%; m % H = 6.714%; m % N = 18.659%; m % O = 42.627%.mo f C in
1 g glicine = 0.2934 g{' '}

### 5. Determining the Empirical Formula

:::note Notes:
An empirical formula represents the lowest whole-number ratio of elements in a compound.  
To find an empirical formula when given percent composition we need:

1. To assume that you have 100 g of the unknown compound;
2. To convert the masses from Step 1 into moles using the molar mass;
3. To determine which element has the smallest mole value. Then divide all the mole values you calculated in Step 2 by this smallest value;
4. If any of your mole ratios aren’t whole numbers, multiply all numbers by the smallest possible factor that produces whole-number mole ratios for all the elements;
5. To write the empirical formula by attaching these whole-number mole ratios as subscripts to the chemical symbol of each element.
:::

#### Example

Calculate the empirical formula of the ionic compound calcium carbonate, used as building material. Elemental analysis indicates that it contains 40% calcium, 12% carbon, and 48% oxygen.  
**Given:** percent composition  
**Asked for:** empirical formula

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Assume a 100 g sample and calculate the number of moles of each element in that sample.  
**B.** Obtain the relative numbers of atoms of each element in the compound by dividing the number of moles of each element in the 100 g sample by the number of moles of the element present in the smallest amount.  
**C.** If the ratios are not integers, multiply all subscripts by the same number to give integral values.  
**D.** Because this is an ionic compound, identify the anion and cation and write the formula so that the charges are balanced.

**Solution:**  
**A.** A 100 g sample of calcium carbonate contains 40 g of calcium, 12 g of carbon, and 48 g of oxygen. Dividing the mass of each element in the 100 g sample by its molar mass gives the number of moles of each element in the sample:

<Math code="moles\ Ca\ =\ 40\ g\ Ca\frac{1\ mol\ Ca}{40.078\ g\ Ca}·100\%" />
<br /><br />
<Math code="moles\ C\ =\ 12\ g\ C\frac{1\ mol\ C}{12.011\ g\ C}·100\%" />
<br /><br />
<Math code="moles\ O\ =\ 48\ g\ O\frac{1\ mol\ O}{15.999\ g\ O}·100\%" />
<br />

**B.** To obtain the relative    numbers of atoms of each element in the compound, divide the number of moles of each element in the 100-g sample by the number of moles of the element in the smallest amount, in this case calcium:  

<Math code="Ca:\ \frac{0.9980\ mol\ C}{0.9980\ mol\ C}\ =\ 1.0" />
<br /><br />
<Math code="C:\ \frac{0.9990\ mol\ C}{0.9980\ mol\ Ca}\ =\ 1.001" />
<br /><br />
<Math code="O:\ \frac{3.0011\ mol\ O}{0.9980\ mol\ C}\ =\ 3.007" />
<br />

**C.** We can write the empirical formula of calcium carbonate as Ca<sub>1.000</sub>С<sub>1.001</sub>O<sub>3.007</sub>. The deviation from integral atomic ratios is small and can be attributed to minor experimental errors; therefore, the empirical formula is CaCO<sub>3</sub>.  
**D.** The calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is a cation, carbonate ion (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) is an anion. Hence the formula of the ionic compound is CaCO<sub>3</sub>  

**Answer:**  
CaCO<sub>3</sub>  

### 6. Determining the Empirical Formula from Combustion Analysis  

:::note Notes:
To determine the empirical formula of a compound from Combustion  
Analysis, we need to take the following steps:  
1. Determine the mass of the sample;  
2. burn the sample in oxygen;  
3. determine the masses of the combustion products;  
4. determine the number of moles of each combustion product and then use the atomic masses of elements to calculate the masses of elements other than oxygen in the original sample;  
5. find the mass of oxygen by finding the difference between the total mass of the organic compound and the mass of all other elements;  
6. use element percentage to calculate moles of C, H, N, S in a 100 g sample;  
7. divide the moles of each element by the moles of element present in the smallest amount;  
8. multiply by nonintegral ratios as necessary to give small whole numbers.
:::

#### Example 

Complete combustion of a 10.5 g sample of organic compound in oxygen yielded 33g of CO<sub>2</sub> and 13.5g of H<sub>2</sub>O. Determine the empirical formula of the organic compound.  
**Given:** mass of sample and mass of combustion products  
**Asked for:** empirical formula

**Strategy:**  
**A.** Use the masses and molar masses of the combustion products, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, to calculate the masses of carbon and hydrogen present in the original sample of organic compound.  
**B.** Find the mass of oxygen by finding the difference between the total mass of the organic compound and the mass of carbon and hydrogen.  
**С.** Use those masses and the molar masses of the elements to calculate the empirical formula of the organic compound.  

**Solution:**   
**A.** Upon combustion, 1 mol of CO<sub>2</sub> is produced for each mole of carbon atoms in the original sample. Similarly, 1 mol of H<sub>2</sub>O is produced for every 2 mol of hydrogen atoms present in the sample. The masses of carbon and hydrogen in the original sample can be calculated from these ratios, the masses of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, and their molar masses. Because the units of molar mass are grams per mole, we must first convert the masses from milligrams to grams:  
Find the mass of carbon: <Math top='15px' code="\frac{m(CO_2)}{M(CO_2)}:\frac{m(C)}{M(C)}=\frac{33g}{44.010\ g}:\frac{x\ g}{12.011\ g}=9.006g" />  

Find the mass of hydrogen: <Math top='15px' code="\frac{m(H_2O)}{M(H_2O)}:\frac{m(H)}{M(H)}=\frac{13.5g}{18.015\ g}:\frac{x\ g}{2.0158\ g}=1.5105g" />  

**B.** Find the mass of oxygen: m(O) = m (organic compound) - (m(C)+m(H)) = 10.5- (9.006+1.5105) = 0 (no oxygen)  
**C.** To obtain the relative numbers of atoms of both elements present, we need to calculate the number of moles of each and divide by the number of moles of the element present in the smallest amount:  
Moles C: <Math top='15px' code='n=\frac{m}{M}:\frac{9.006\ g}{12.011\ gmol^-1}=\ 0.75\ mol\ C' />  

Moles H: <Math top='15px' code='n=\frac{m}{M}:\frac{1.5105\ g}{1.0079\ gmol^-1}=\ 1.5\ mol\ H' />  

Dividing each number by the number of moles of the element present in the smaller amount gives
<Math top='15px' code='C:\ \frac{0.75}{0.75}=1.00' /><br/>
<Math top='15px' code='H:\ \frac{1.5}{0.75}=2.00' /><br/> 
  <br/> 
Thus, the organic compound contains a 1:2 ratio of moles of carbon to moles of hydrogen: CH<sub>2</sub>. It is an empirical formula of the organic compound. In fact, the molecular formula of the organic compound is C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, which is consistent with our results.  

Answer: The empirical formula is CH<sub>2</sub>.
