  <AudioButton url='/media/294.d5293bce.mp3' /> – CaSO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O an almost transparent, white stone, often used for making decorative objects.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>barium meal</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/295.a8cbe5ac.mp3' /> - barium sulphate, that is swallowed by a person just before an X-ray is taken of their stomach and bowels, so that these organs can be seen clearly.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>calcium hydroxide</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/296.15acd4c8.mp3' /> – Ca(OH)<sub>a</sub> white alkaline chemical compound used to make cement and plaster and to reduce acidity in soil.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>calcium carbonate</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/297.41d4b6e0.mp3' /> – CaCO<sub>3</sub>, a common, white chemical compound found naturally as chalk, marble and limestone, and in bones and shells, etc.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>flame test</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/298.86640336.mp3' /> –  a test for the presence of particular metal ions, involving holding the substance in a flame. Different ions produce different coloured flames due to a different pattern of electron transitions and corresponding energy emissions on heating.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>limestone</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/299.3c060021.mp3' /> – a white or light grey rock that is used as a building material and in the making of cement.
