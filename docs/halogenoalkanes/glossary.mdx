</p>
<p>
  <strong>chlorofluorocarbon</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/200.a7c8b430.mp3' /> - a  type of halogenoalkane containing chlorine and fluorine atoms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>chlorofluoroalkanes</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/201.49cccde7.mp3' /> have been responsible for damaging the Earth’s ozone layer, but alternative inert compounds, such as fluoroalkanes, are now replacing the use of CFCs.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electrophile</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/202.b97a4f83.mp3' /> – a species that takes part in a reaction by accepting a lone pair of electrons from a nucleophile.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electrophilic addition</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/203.1673f9d4.mp3' /> – a reaction in which an electrophile attacks a double bond and becomes bonded to one of the atoms that formed the double bond by a single covalent bond. One example is the formation of halogenoalkanes from alkenes, in which a halide ion attacks a carbon–carbon double bond.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>elimination</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/204.bba14be9.mp3' /> – a reaction in which atoms are lost from a molecule but not replaced by others. One example is the reaction between a halogenoalkane and a base, forming an alkene, a halide ion, and water.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>fluoro</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/205.c58bf201.mp3' /> – the prefix used in the name of a halogenoalkane to indicate it contains at least one fluorine atom.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>free radical</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/206.e4af9cfd.mp3' /> – a highly reactive atom or group of atoms containing one or more unpaired electrons. One example is a chloride ion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>free radical substitution</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/207.ae8736d4.mp3' /> -   a reaction in which a free radical attack an atom or group of atoms with a partial positive charge (an electrophile), substituting an existing atom or group of atoms called the leaving group. One example is the formation of halogenoalkanes from alkanes, in which a halogen atom substitutes a hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>halogenoalkanes</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/208.d4c99aea.mp3' /> – a group of organic molecules that are similar to alkanes but in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by one or more halogen atoms. Also known as haloalkanes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>homolytic fission</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/209.073ca943.mp3' /> – the process in which a covalent bond is broken and one electron from the bond goes to each atom that formed the bond.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>hydrolysis</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/210.6bfe9ce7.mp3' /> – the nucleophilic substitution of a halogenoalkane with a hydroxide ion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>initiation</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/211.744efa0b.mp3' /> – the first step of a free radical substitution reaction, in which a free radical is formed by homolytic fission.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>iodo</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/212.c3e4403b.mp3' /> – the prefix used in the name of a halogenoalkane to indicate it contains at least one iodine atom.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>nucleophilic substitution</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/213.a255fb63.mp3' /> – a reaction in which a nucleophile attacks an atom or group of atoms with a partial positive charge (an electrophile),substituting an existing atom or group of atoms called the leaving group. One example is the reaction of a halogenoalkane and ammonia, resulting in an amine and ammonium halide.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>nucleophilic substitution</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/214.bb02a764.mp3' /> – R-X + 2NH<sub>3</sub> → R-NH<sub>2</sub> + NH<sub>4</sub>X
</p>
<p>
  <strong>nucleophilic substitution</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/215.d80501fb.mp3' /> – R-X + OH- → R-OH + X<sup>-</sup>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>nucleophile</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/216.7c2422fb.mp3' /> – an ion or molecule that donates a lone pair of electrons to form a covalent bond. Nucleophiles are attracted to atoms with a slight positive charge, such as those involved in a polar bonds.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>primary halogenoalkane</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/217.01575378.mp3' /> – the halogen atom is bonded to a carbon atom, which is itself bonded to one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>propagation</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/218.b241123a.mp3' /> – one or more steps in a free radical substitution reaction that follow initiation, in which new free radicals are created to continue the reaction.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>R group</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/219.b6cbd7b5.mp3' /> –  a symbol (R) used to represent an unspecified side chain or carbon chain in an organic molecule.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>SN 2 mechanism of reaction</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/220.2fdf1cd7.mp3' /> is characteristic of primary haloalkanes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>SN 1 mechanism of reaction</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/223.b66d2846.mp3' /> is characteristic of tertiary haloalkanes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>SN 1 mechanism and the SN 2 mechanism</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/221.6082c883.mp3' /> are both likely to play a part in the nucleophilic substitution of secondary.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>substitution</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/222.81d9be93.mp3' /> - a reaction in which an atom in a molecule is replaced by another atom or group of atoms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>termination</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/224.f7c15a19.mp3' /> - one or more steps in a free-radical substitution reaction that follow propagation, in which one free radical combine with another, leading to the end of the reaction.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>tertiary halogenoalkane</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/225.2fdaf075.mp3' /> - the carbon atom bonded to the halogen atom is also bonded to three other carbon atoms (alkyl groups).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>tertiary carbocations</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/226.55f6f9c8.mp3' /> are more stable than primary carbocations due to the inductive effect of the alkyl groups attached to the carbon atom bonded to the halogen.
