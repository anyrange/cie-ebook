If  one   or more   of  the   hydrogen atoms    in  an  alkane    molecule are   replaced by   halogen atoms,    the   compound is  called a  halogenoalkane. Iodoalkanes are   the   most    reactive    halogenoalkanes, whereas fluoroalkanes are   the   least   reactive.    This   is  explained by  the   trend    in  the   bond    strength of  the carbon‚Äìhalogen bonds.    The   C-F   bond   is  the   strongest bond, and   the  C-I,   bond   is  the  weakest     bond.    So,  the  C-I  bond   is  most easily   broken    during    its  reactions. Halogenoalkanes are  attacked    by  nucleophiles. A  nucleophile is  a  species    with   a  lone   pair of electrons which    it  can  use  to  bond   with   an  electropositive carbon  atom    on  an  organic     molecule. Suitable nucleophiles include aqueous alkali, OH‚Äì (aq), cyanide, CN‚Äì, and ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>.  
The   reaction    with   OH‚Äìions     (or  with   water)    is  known    as  hydrolysis, and   an  alcohol    is  formed.     Halogenoalkanes will also   undergo elimination reactions when    heated    with   ethanolic sodium hydroxide, forming alkenes.  
The   fluoroalkanes and   fluorohalogenoalkanes have    many uses,   including anaesthetics solvents, refrigerants and   aerosol propellants. Chlorofluoroalkanes have    been    responsible for damaging the  Earth‚Äôs    ozone   layer,   but  alternative inert   compounds, such as fluoroalkanes, are now replacing the use of CFCs.
