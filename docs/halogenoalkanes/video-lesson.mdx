### After you watch:

#### Exercise 5. By how many millions of kilometers will the ozone hole shrink by 2040?

In 1989 the Montreal Protocol banned the production of ozone-depleting substances. Since then the amount of chlorine and other ozone-depleting elements in the atmosphere have been falling. Scientists estimate that chlorine levels will return to their natural state in about 50 years. By then the Antarctic ozone hole will shrink to smaller than eight million square miles.
