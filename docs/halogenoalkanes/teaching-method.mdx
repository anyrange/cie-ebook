## Case Study

To prepare students for jobs that haven’t been created yet, we need to teach them how to be great problem solvers so that they’ll be ready for anything. One way to do this is by teaching content and skills using real-world case studies, a learning model that’s focused on reflection during the problem-solving process. It’s similar to project-based learning, but PBL is more focused on students creating a product.  
What does case study work look like in classrooms? Teachers generally start by having students read the case or watch a video that summarizes the case. Students then work in small groups or individually to solve the case study.  
Case studies have been used for years by businesses, law and medical schools, physicians on rounds, and artists critiquing work. Like other forms of problem-based learning, case studies can be accessible for every age group, both in one subject and in interdisciplinary work.  
You can get started with case studies by tackling relatable questions like these with your students:  
- **How can we limit food waste in the cafeteria?**
- **How can we get our school to recycle and compost waste? (or, if you want to be more complex, how can our school reduce its carbon footprint?)**
- **How can we improve school attendance?**
- **How can we reduce the number of people who get sick at school during cold and flu season?**

Addressing questions like these leads students to identify topics they need to learn more about. In researching the first question, for example, students may see that they need to research food chains and nutrition. Students often ask, reasonably, why they need to learn something, or when they’ll use their knowledge in the future. Learning is most successful for students when the content and skills they’re studying are relevant, and case studies offer one way to create that sense of relevance.  
During the case study learning process, student assessment of learning should be focused on reflection.
