## “Jigsaw Reading”

Students work with one text which is  divided  into  3-4-5  sections.  The teacher splits the class into groups of four learners. Each group is given a copy of a different part of the text: a learner A gets a text A, B a text B and so on. A new task is provided which requires all the learners to gather into new group ABCD where they communicate about what they have just read to each other.
