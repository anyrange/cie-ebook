## Assignments:

  <dt>
    <strong>
      1. Using example, develop tasks for one of the following videos: your
      video worksheet should have THREE PHASES:
    </strong>
    <em> pre-watching, while-watching</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>
      post-watching
    </em> <strong>exercises.</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <li>
      <a href='https://youtu.be/wXingx2RokI'>
        Halogens & Their Compounds
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href='https://youtu.be/JG8HL9BXN40'>
        What Are The Reactions Of Halogens 
      </a>

### Learning objectives:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.2.1.8 understand and be able to account for the trends in electronegativity and boiling point, be able to account for the decreasing oxidising ability down the group
    </td>
    <td>
      11.2.1.11 be able to identify halide ions using silver nitrate and ammonia solution
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.2.1.9 recognise the displacement reactions of the halogens
    </td>
    <td>
      11.2.1.12 know how chlorine water is formed and the reactions of chlorine with aqueous sodium hydroxide
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.2.1.10 understand and be able to account for the trend in reducing abilities of the halide ions
    </td>
    <td>
      11.2.1.13 understand the use of chlorine as a water treatment and understand the balance of risks and benefits in this process
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### 2. Develop one of the fragments of Lesson plan: you should use

- a lesson plan template [(**Appendix 1**)](../appendix/appendix-1);
- one of the CLIL techniques (**Appendix 2**);
- teaching methods; and
- learning objectives above.
