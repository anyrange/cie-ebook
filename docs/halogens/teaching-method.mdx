## Formative assessment strategies

Innovative formative assessment examples are part of what defines any modern classroom. They provide crucial information about what students understand and what they don’t.

<center>
  <strong>1. ANALYZING STUDENT WORK</strong>
</center>
A great deal of information can be learnt from the students’ homework, tests and
quizzes. This is especially so if the students are required to explain their thinking.
When teachers take the time to analyze student work, they gain knowledge about:
<dl>
  <dd>
    <li>
      A student's current knowledge, attitudes, and skills about subject matter
    </li>
    <li>Strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles</li>
    <li>Need for further, or special, assistance</li>
  </dd>
</dl>
This approach lets teachers modify their instruction to be more effective in the
future.<br/><br/>
<center>
  <strong>2. ROUND ROBIN CHARTS</strong>
</center>
This strategy involves passing charts among groups to assess understanding. Each
group of 4 or 5 students begins with a chart and some markers. The group records
an answer to an open-ended question. They can also share knowledge they have on a
topic covered in class. Once the students finish with the chart, they pass it on
to the next group. Once every group has worked on every chart, responses are discussed
as a class.<br/><br/>
<center>
  <strong>3. STRATEGIC QUESTIONING</strong>
</center>
Questioning strategies may be used with individuals, small groups, or the entire
class. Effective formative assessment strategies involve asking students to answer
higher-order questions such as “why” and “how”. **Higher-order questions require
more in-depth thinking from the students**. They can help the teacher discern the
level and extent of the students’ understanding.<br/><br/>
<center>
  <strong>4. 3-WAY SUMMARIES</strong>
</center>
The idea here is to use different modes of thinking and attention to detail. Students
can work in groups or individually. In response to a question or topic inquiry, they
write three different summaries:
<dl>
  <dd>
    <li>10–15 words long</li>
    <li>30–50 words long</li>
    <li>75–100 words long</li>
  </dd>
</dl><br/><br/>
<center>
  <strong>5. THINK-PAIR-SHARE</strong>
</center>
This is one of the many formative assessment strategies that is simple for teachers
to use. The instructor asks a question, and students write down their answers. Students
are then placed in pairs to discuss their responses. Teachers are able to move around
the classroom and listen to various discussions. **It lets them gain valuable insight
into levels of understanding**.<br/><br/>
<center>
  <strong>6. 3–2–1 COUNTDOWN</strong>
</center>
This is a true test of relevant and meaningful learning. **When students learn something,
they find useful, they're likely to want to use that learning in some way**. Have
students end the day with this one. Give them cards to write on, or they can respond
orally. They are required to respond to three separate statements:
<dl>
  <dd>
    <li>3 things you didn't know before</li>
    <li>2 things that surprised you about this topic</li>
    <li>1 thing you want to start doing with what you've learned</li>
  </dd>
</dl>
You can also ask them different kinds of questions. These are suggestions, so feel
free to make up your own.<br/><br/>
<center>
  <strong>7. CLASSROOM POLLS</strong>
</center>
Polls let students give responses quickly and accurately. **A silent poll is perfect
for those "shy" students who have trouble speaking up**. These are also a quick way
to check understanding using mobile technology. Try tools like Poll Everywhere or
Survey Planet.<br/><br/>
<center>
  <strong>8. EXIT/ADMIT TICKETS</strong>
</center>
A simple but effective formative assessment is the exit ticket. **Exit tickets are
small pieces of paper or cards that students deposit as they leave the classroom**.
Students write down an accurate interpretation of the main idea behind the lesson
taught that day. Next, they provide more detail about the topic. Admit tickets are
done at the very beginning of the class. Students may respond to questions about
homework, or on the lesson taught the day before.
<center><br/><br/>
  <strong>9. ONE-MINUTE PAPERS</strong>
</center>
One-minute papers are usually done at the end of the day. Students can work individually
or in groups here. They must answer a brief question in writing. Typical questions
posed by teachers center around:
<dl>
  <dd>
    <li>Main point</li>
    <li>Most surprising concept</li>
    <li>Questions not answered</li>
    <li>Most confusing area of topic</li>
    <li>What question from the topic might appear on the next test.</li>
  </dd>
</dl>
**Without formative assessments, the first indication that a student doesn’t grasp
the material is when they fail a quiz or a test**. An innovative formative assessment
strategy like this can take failure out of the classroom.<br/><br/>
<center>
  <strong>10. CREATIVE EXTENSION PROJECTS</strong>
</center>
Students can create a large scope of projects to demonstrate comprehension. These
don't have to be big and complicated. They can take a day, a half-day, or even an
hour. Here are some extension ideas for quick projects:
<dl>
  <dd>
    <li>Create a poster or collage illustrating the subject matter</li>
    <li>Record a rehearsed skit or podcast discussing the topics covered</li>
    <li>Build a diorama about the subject and create a narrative behind it</li>
    <li>Let students design their own flashcards to test each other with</li>
    <li>Keynote presentations made by students on the topic.</li>
