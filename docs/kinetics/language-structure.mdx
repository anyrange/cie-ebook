### DESCRIBING PROCESSES

While describing processes, <strong>passive  voice</strong> can be used because the action (agent) is more important than the person doing this action.<br/>


<dl>
  <dt><strong>Simple present passive: Agent +is/are + V<sub>ed/3</sub></strong></dt>
  <dd><em>e.g.</em>  When a chemical reaction occurs, <u>energy is transferred</u> to or from the surroundings. (energy <sub>(agent)</sub> + is + transferred).</dd>
  <dd><em>e.g.</em>   In  an  endothermic  reaction, <u>heat  is  absorbed</u>  from  the surroundings. (heat <sub>(agent)</sub> + is + absorbed from).</dd>
  <dd><em>e.g.</em>  The standard enthalpy change of combustion is the enthalpy change when <u>one mole of a substance is burnt</u> in excess oxygen under standard conditions. (a substance <sub>(agent)</sub> + is + burnt).</dd>
  <dt><b>Modal passive:can + be +V<sub>ed/3</sub></b></dt>
  <dd><em>e.g.</em> Hess’s law <u>can be used</u> to calculate enthalpy changes for reactions  that  do  not  occur  directly  or <u>cannot  be  found</u>  by experiment. (Hess’s las <sub>(agent)</sub> + can + be+ used), (reactions <sub>(agent)</sub> + cannot + be + found). </dd>
