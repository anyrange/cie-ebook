  <strong>bond enthalpy</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/78.4c4cb864.mp3" /> - the average bond dissociation enthalpy for a particular bond in a range of different compounds. Precisely, it is the average enthalpy change for breaking one mole of a particular bond in a range of different compounds in the gas phase.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>calorimetry</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/79.8387e651.mp3" /> – a technique used for measuring the amount of heat energy absorbed or given out by a reaction.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>‘Delta H’ </strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/80.90280f35.mp3" /> - ΔH – the symbol used to represent enthalpy change.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>endothermic reaction</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/81.da7b7d1c.mp3" /> – a chemical reaction in which heat energy is taken in from the surroundings. ΔH for the reaction is positive
</p>
<p>
  <strong>enthalpy</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/82.79589ef7.mp3" /> – a measure of the energy stored in (or heat content of) a system. Given the symbol H.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>enthalpy change (for a reaction)</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/83.1b6dad53.mp3" /> – the heat energy exchange between the reacting system and its surroundings at constant pressure.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>enthalpy level diagram</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/84.7ddaae9d.mp3" /> – a diagram showing the amount of energy contained in both the reactants and the products for a reaction, and the difference between them. Also called an enthalpy profile diagram.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>exothermic reaction</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/85.40ab116d.mp3" /> – a chemical reaction in which heat energy is given out to the surroundings. ΔH for the reaction is negative.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hess cycle </strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/86.531f2ff3.mp3" /> - a diagram showing a reaction taking place by two or more alternative routes, all of which involve the same enthalpy change, according to Hess’s law. Also called an enthalpy cycle.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hess’s Law</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/87.e54687af.mp3" /> - a rule stating that the overall enthalpy change for a reaction is independent of the route the reaction takes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>specific heat capacity </strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/88.d149cc69.mp3" /> –  the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Kelvin (or Celsius).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>standard enthalpy of combustion</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/89.03ed8cac.mp3" /> – the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance undergoes complete combustion under standard conditions (298 K and 100 kPa), with all substances being in their standard states.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>standard enthalpy of formation</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/90.eb7351da.mp3" /> –  the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance is formed from its elements under standard conditions (298 K and 100 kPa), with all substances being in their standard states.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>standard enthalpy of neutralization</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/91.1b2524ae.mp3" /> – the enthalpy change when 1 mole of water is produced by the reaction of an acid and a base under standard conditions (298 K and 100 kPa), with all substances being in their standard states.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>standard enthalpy of reaction</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/92.31164233.mp3" /> – the enthalpy change for a reaction under standard conditions (298 K and 100 kPa), with all substances being in their standard states.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>standard state</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/93.1d0e2c4d.mp3" /> – the state a substance is in under standard conditions (298 K and 100 kPa).
