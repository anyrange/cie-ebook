The decrease in the concentration of reactants per unit time, or the increase in the concentration of products per unit time, is known as the rate of reaction. The number of collisions between particles per unit time in a system is known as the collision frequency of the system.  
Collisions  which  do  not  result  in  a  reaction  are  known  as unsuccessful collisions. Unsuccessful collisions happen when the colliding species do not have enough energy to break the necessary bonds. If they do not have sufficient energy, the collision will not result in a chemical reaction. If they have sufficient energy, they will react, and the collision will be successful. The combined energy of the colliding particles is known as the collision energy.  
Not all the particles in a given system have the same energy; they have a broad distribution of different energies. The shape of the distribution of energies depends on the temperature of the system: the higher the temperature, the greater the mean kinetic energy of the particles.  
The  distribution  of  molecular  energies  at  a  characteristic temperature can be represented graphically. It is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.  
The minimum energy the colliding particles need in order to react is known as the activation energy. If the collision energy of the colliding particles is less than the activation energy, the collision will be unsuccessful. If the collision energy is equal to or greater than the activation energy, the collision will be successful, and a reaction will take place. The activation energy can be changed by the addition of a catalyst. It provides an alternative reaction pathway, usually by introducing an extra step into the reaction, which has a lower activation energy than the uncatalyzed reaction.  
A catalyst increases the rate of reaction because   
- the activation energy of the particles decreases
- so more of the particles have a collision energy greater than the activation energy
- so, the fraction of successful collisions increases  
  
The rate of a chemical reaction can be changed in a number of ways.  
The greater the concentration of the species in a liquid or gaseous mixture, the greater the number of species per unit volume and the greater the frequency with which they will collide. Hence, an increase in concentration causes the rate of reaction to increase by increasing the collision frequency.  
The greater the pressure in a gaseous mixture, the greater the number of species per unit volume and the greater the frequency with which they will collide. Hence, an increase in pressure causes the rate of reaction to increase by increasing the collision frequency. The pressure of a system is generally increased by reducing its volume.  
An increase in temperature increases the rate of a reaction.  
An increase in temperature increases the rate of reaction because  
- the mean collision energy of the particles increases
- so more of the particles have a collision energy greater than the activation energy
- so the fraction of successful collisions increases
- and the particles are moving faster
- so the collision frequency increases   
  
The relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentration of the reactants is shown by the rate equation of the reaction. The order of reaction with respect to a given reactant is the power of that reactant‚Äôs concentration in the rate equation.The overall order of reaction is the sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate equation. The rate constant is the constant of proportionality in the rate equation.  
If the reaction is first order, and the concentration is doubled the rate will also double. If the concentration triples the rate will also triple, etc.  
If the reaction is second order, and the concentration doubles the rate will quadruple. If the concentration triples the rate will increase nine-fold, etc.  
If the reaction is zero order, then a change in concentration will have no effect on the rate of reaction.  
The order of reaction with respect to each reactant can be deduced by plotting a graph of concentration vs initial rate (an initial rate-concentration graph).  
<ol type="a">
  <li>If rate = k[A] (first-order reaction), then a plot of initial rate against initial concentration will be a straight line through the origin with gradient k.</li>
  <li>If rate = k[A] 2 (second-order reaction), then a plot of initial rate against initial concentration will be a curve through the origin.</li>
  <li>If rate = k (zero-order reaction), then a plot of initial rate against initial concentration will be a horizontal line.</li>
</ol>
  
The rate equation of a chemical reaction is determined by the number of each species involved in the rate-determining step of that reaction.  
If the temperature is increased, the rate constant k will increase. If the temperature is decreased, the rate constant k will decrease. If the concentration or pressure is changed at constant temperature, the rate constant will not change.
