    <strong>
      1. Using example, develop tasks for one of the following videos: your
      video worksheet should have THREE PHASES:
    </strong>
    <em> pre-watching, while-watching</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>
      post-watching
    </em> <strong>exercises.</strong>

### Learning objectives:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.2.3.1 recall concepts from earlier grades: oxidation as gain of oxygen
      and reduction as gain of hydrogen, oxidation and reduction in terms of
      electron gain and loss
    </td>
    <td>
      11.2.3.4 use electrode potentials to establish an electrochemical series
    </td>
    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.2.3.2 know and be able to use the rules for assigning oxidation numbers
      and be able to assign oxidation numbers to individual elements in
      compounds
    </td>
    <td>
      11.2.3.5 understand the electrochemical cell in terms of conventional
      representations
    </td>

      fuel cell
    </td>
  </tr>

      11.2.3.3 be able to write oxidising and reducing half equations and to
      combine them into an overall redox equation
    </td>
    <td>
      11.2.3.6 know that standard electrode potentials require standard
      conditions
    </td>
    <td>
      11.2.3.9 understand electrochemical cells as a source of energy, including
      the constituents of commercial cells

#### 2. Develop one of the fragments of Lesson plan: you should use

- a lesson plan template [(**Appendix 1**)](../appendix/1);
- one of the CLIL techniques [(**Appendix 2**)](../appendix/2);
- teaching methods; and
- learning objectives above.
