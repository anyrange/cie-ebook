## Glossary

<p>
  <strong>anode</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/255.b075e129.mp3' /> -  the positive electrode.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electrochemical cell</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/256.d10dc236.mp3' /> – two half cells connected by a salt bridge, creating a potential difference that can be used to produce a current in a complete circuit.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electrochemical series</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/257.f2a4ffba.mp3' /> - a list of standard electrode potentials ordered with the more negative electrode potentials at the top and the more positive potentials at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electrode</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/258.e074ea74.mp3' /> – the part of a half cell at which either oxidation or reduction occurs.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electrode potential</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/259.ca3334c4.mp3' /> – a measure of how likely a half cell is to gain electrons. Represented by E (or E<sup>θ</sup> under standard conditions) and sometimes called reduction potentials. The electrode potential of a half cell cannot be measured directly but must be calculated by connecting the half cell to a standard hydrogen electrode. Half cells with negative values of E<sup>θ</sup> are less likely to gain electrons (i.e. worse reducing agents) than hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electrolysis</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/260.6e1d4c2f.mp3' /> –  the process of passing an electric current through a molten or aqueous compound to split it into elements.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electromotive force (e.m.f)</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/261.a9d7d1e8.mp3' /> – the maximum voltage an electrochemical cell can produce. This can only be observed when negligible current flows.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>cathode</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/262.32e0fd92.mp3' /> – the negative electrode.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>cryolite</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/263.471a8c2f.mp3' /> –  the sub-stance Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>(sodium hexafluo-roaluminate) used to dissolve alumin-ium oxide to make the electrolyte for the extraction of aluminium by elec-trolysis.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>displacement reaction</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/264.daa158f3.mp3' /> -  a reaction in which an element is displaced out of a compound by a more reactive element; for example, bromine displaces iodine in: Br<sub>2</sub>+2KI → 2KBr+I<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>disproportionation</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/265.952fb110.mp3' /> – a reaction in which the same element is both oxidized and reduced; for exam-ple, chlorine in: Cl<sub>2</sub>+ H<sub>2</sub>O → HCl + HOCl.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>half-cell</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/266.fd0e2d0e.mp3' /> – half of an electrochemical cell, where either oxidation or reduction occurs. It consists of an electrode in contact with a solution of ions. The simplest half cells are a metal electrode immersed in a solution of metal ions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>half-equation</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/267.2e0aa4d2.mp3' /> – an equation describing either the oxidation or reduction in a redox reaction; for example, Cl<sub>2</sub>+ 2e<sup>-</sup> → 2Cl<sup>-</sup> shows the reduction of chlorine to chloride ions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>hydrogen electrode</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/268.3eddfa13.mp3' /> – the half-cell against which all other electrode potentials are measured. Also known as the standard hydrogen electrode. It consists of a 1 mol/dm3 solution of H+ ions, in which is immersed a platinum-covered electrode, and over which is passed hydrogen gas at standard temperature and pressure. The half equation is 2H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>+ 2e<sup>-</sup> → H<sub>2(g)</sub>, and the standard electrode potential is 0.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>oxidation</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/269.8cad8a31.mp3' /> – a reaction in which a substance loses electrons or increases its oxidation state.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>oxidation half equation</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/270.5c7a0f8c.mp3' /> – a half-equation where the reactant loses at least one electron. It is written with the electrons on the right of the arrow, i.e. as oxidation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>oxidation number</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/271.ce59ff07.mp3' /> –  a simple way of keeping track of redox reactions, so that it is easy to see which species have been oxidized and which reduced. Also known as an oxidation state.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>oxidation state</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/272.e72c578b.mp3' /> – the charge a particular atom in a compound would have if the compound consisted entirely of separate ions. Also called the oxidation number.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>oxidizing agent</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/273.e53dcaf0.mp3' /> – the species that accepts electrons, thus oxidizing another species while it is itself reduced.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>redox</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/274.d3f59c91.mp3' /> – a chemical reaction that involves oxidation and a reduction.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>reduction</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/275.d252cbc5.mp3' /> – a reaction in which a substance gains at least one electron or decreases its oxidation state.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>reducing agent</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/276.c66629a9.mp3' /> – a species that donates electrons, thus reducing another species while it is itself oxidized.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>reduction half equation</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/277.b4943e6f.mp3' /> – a half- equation where the reactant gains at least one electron. It is written with the electrons on the left of the arrow, i.e. as a reduction (sometimes known as a reduction potential). Electrodes with negative values of E<sup>θ</sup> are better at releasing electrons (better-reducing agents) than hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>salt bridge</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/278.1d90e918.mp3' /> – provides electrical contact between solutions without allowing them to mix. The simplest salt bridge is a piece of paper soaked in a saturated salt solution, such as KCl<sub>(aq)</sub>, KNO<sub>3(aq)</sub> or NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3(aq)</sub>. A better version is a glass tube filled with the salt in jelly form.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>spectator ion</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/279.54155d00.mp3' /> – an ion that does not take part in a reaction, but remains unchanged. Spectator ions may still appear in the overall redox equation for the reaction.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>standard electrode potential</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/280.cc784dcd.mp3' /> – the potential difference between a particular electrode and a standard hydrogen electrode when both half cells are under standard conditions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>standard hydrogen electrode</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/281.b5a90526.mp3' /> – the half-cell against which all other electrode potentials are measured. Also known as the standard hydrogen electrode. It consists of a 1moldm<sup>-3</sup> solution of H<sup>+</sup> ions, in which is immersed a platinum-covered electrode, and over which is passed hydrogen gas at standard temperature and pressure. The half equation is 2H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2e<sup>-</sup> → H<sub>2(g)</sub>, and the standard electrode potential is 0.
