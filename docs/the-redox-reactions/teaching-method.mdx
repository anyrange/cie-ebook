## Effective feedback

A teacher has the distinct responsibility to nurture a student’s learning and to provide feedback in such a manner that the student does not leave the classroom feeling defeated. Here you will find 20 ideas and techniques on how to give effective learning feedback that will leave your students with the feeling they can conquer the world.

<ol>
  <strong>
    <li>Feedback should be educative in nature.</li>
  </strong>
  Providing feedback means giving students an explanation of what they are doing
  correctly AND incorrectly. However, the focus of the feedback should be based essentially
  on what the students is doing right. It is most productive to a student’s learning
  when they are provided with an explanation and example as to what is accurate and
  inaccurate about their work.
  <br />
  Consider using the concept of a ‘feedback sandwich’ to guide your feedback: Compliment,
  Correct, Compliment.
  <strong>
    <li>Feedback should be given in a timely manner.</li>
  </strong>
  When feedback is given immediately after showing proof of learning, the student
  responds positively and remembers the experience about what is being learned in
  a confident manner. If we wait too long to give feedback, the moment is lost and
  the student might not connect the feedback with the action.
  <strong>
    <li>Be sensitive to the individual needs of the student.</li>
  </strong>
  It is vital that we take into consideration each student individually when giving
  feedback. Our classrooms are full of diverse learners. Some students need to be
  nudged to achieve at a higher level and other needs to be handled very gently so
  as not to discourage learning and damage self-esteem. A balance between not wanting
  to hurt a student’s feelings and providing proper encouragement is essential.
  <strong>
    <li>Ask the 4 questions.</li>
  </strong>
  Studies of effective teaching and learning (Dinham, 2002, 2007a; 2007b) have shown
  that learners want to know where they stand in regards to their work. Providing
  answers to the following four questions on a regular basis will help provide quality
  feedback. These four questions are also helpful when providing feedback to parents:
  <br />
  <dl>
    <dd>What can the student do?</dd>
    <dd>What can’t the student do?</dd>
    <dd>How does the student’s work compare with that of others?</dd>
    <dd>How can the student do better?</dd>
  </dl>
  <strong>
    <li>Feedback should reference a skill or specific knowledge.</li>
  </strong>
  This is when rubrics become a useful tool (single-point rubric, for example). A
  rubric is an instrument to communicate expectations for an assignment. Effective
  rubrics provide students with very specific information about their performance,
  comparative to an established range of standards. For younger students, try highlighting
  rubric items that the student is meeting or try using a sticker chart.
  <strong>
    <li>Host a one-on-one conference</li>
  </strong>
  Providing a one-on-one meeting with a student is one of the most effective means
  of providing feedback. The student will look forward to having the attention and
  allows the opportunity to ask necessary questions. A one-on-one conference should
  be generally optimistic, as this will encourage the student to look forward to
  the next meeting.
  <strong>
    <li>Feedback can be given verbally, non-verbally or in written form.</li>
  </strong>
  Be sure to keep your frowns in check. It is imperative that we examine our non-verbal
  cues. Facial expressions and gestures are also means of delivering feedback. This
  means that when you hand back that English paper, it is best not to scowl.
  <strong>
    <li>Concentrate on one ability.</li>
  </strong>
  It makes a far greater impact on the student when only one skill is critiqued versus
  the entire paper being the focus of everything that is wrong. For example, when
  in Writer’s Workshop at the elementary level, a teacher can let students know that
  for that day he/she was going to be checking on the indentation of paragraphs within
  their writing. The next day would feature a new focus.
  <strong>
    <li>Educate students on how to give feedback to each other. </li>
  </strong>
  Model for students what appropriate feedback looks like and sounds like. As an
  elementary teacher, we call this ‘peer conferencing.’ Train students to give each
  other constructive feedback in a way that is positive and helpful. Encourage students
  to use post-it notes to record the given feedback.
  <strong>
    <li>Have the student take notes.</li>
  </strong>
  During a conference over a test, paper or a general ‘check in,’ have the student
  do the writing while you do the talking. The student can use a notebook to jot
  down notes as you provide the verbal feedback.
  <strong>
    <li>Return tests, papers or comment cards at the beginning of class. </li>
  </strong>
  Returning papers and tests at the beginning of class, rather than at the end, allows
  students to ask necessary questions and to hold a relevant discussion.
  <strong>
    <li>Use Post-It notes.</li>
  </strong>
  Sometimes seeing a comment written out is more effective than just hearing it aloud.
  During independent work time, try writing feedback comments on a post-it note.
  Place the note on the student’s desk the feedback is meant for. One of my former
  students had a difficult time staying on task but he would get frustrated and embarrassed
  when I called him out on his inattentive behaviors in front of the class.
  <strong>
    <li>Give genuine praise.</li>
  </strong>
  Students are quick to figure out which teachers use meaningless praise to win approval.
  If you are constantly telling your students “Good Job” or “Nice Work” then, over
  time, these words become meaningless. Make a big deal out of a student’s A+ on
  that vocabulary test. If you are thrilled with a student’s recent on-task behaviors,
  go above and beyond with the encouragement and praise.
  <strong>
    <li>“I noticed....”</li>
  </strong>
  Make an effort to notice a student’s behavior or effort at a task. For example;
  “I noticed when you regrouped correctly in the hundreds column, you got the problem
  right.” “I noticed you arrived on time to class this entire week.” Acknowledging
  a student and the efforts they are making goes a long way to positively influence
  academic performance.
  <strong>
    <li>Provide a model or example.</li>
  </strong>
  Communicate with your students the purpose for an assessment and/or feedback. Demonstrate
  to students what you are looking for by giving them an example of what an A+ paper
  looks like. Provide a contrast of what a C- paper looks like. This is especially
  important at the upper learning levels.
  <strong>
    <li>Invite students to give you feedback.</li>
  </strong>
  Remember when you finished a class in college and you were given the chance to
  ‘grade’ the professor? How nice was it to finally tell the professor that the reading
  material was so incredibly boring without worrying about it affecting your grade?
  Why not let students give you feedback on how you are doing as a teacher?Make it
  so that they can do it anonymously. What did they like about your class? What didn’t
  they like? If they were teaching the class, what would they do differently? What
  did they learn the most from you as a teacher? If we are open to it, we will quickly
  learn a few things about ourselves as educators.
