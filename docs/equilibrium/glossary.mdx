## Glossary

<p>
  <strong>catalyst</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/108.c4391608.mp3" /> - a substance that speeds up a chemical
  reaction without itself being consumed by the reaction. It works by providing an
  alternative route with a lower activation energy, by which the reaction can take
  place.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>dynamic equilibrium </strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/109.ad9ea182.mp3" /> – the stage in a reversible reaction
  when the rates of the forward and backward reactions are the same and the concentrations
  of the components of the mixture remain constant.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>equilibrium constant</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/110.6aa38bb5.mp3" /> - a value for the ratio of concentration
  of products to reactants at equilibrium. It is constant at a specific temperature.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    K<sub>c</sub>
  </strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/111.208b86c0.mp3" /> – the equilibrium constant given
  in units of concentration. For the general reaction: aA + bB {"<->"} cC + dD <br />
  K<sub>c</sub> is given, in terms of the equilibrium concentrations, by: K<sub>
    c
  </sub> = [C]<sup>c</sup>[D]<sup>d</sup> / [A]<sup>a</sup>[B]<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Le Chatelier’s principle</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/112.6e21e5e6.mp3" /> – a principle stating that if a factor
  affecting the position of an equilibrium is altered, the position of the equilibrium
  changes to oppose the effect of the change.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>mole fraction</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/113.64e7c119.mp3" /> – the mole fraction of a component
  is equal to the number of moles of the component in a mixture divided by the total
  number of moles. <br />
  mole fraction of A = no. moles of A / total no. moles of all components.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>partial pressure</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/114.8f7efac2.mp3" /> – the pressure that a gas would exert
  if it were the only gas present. The partial pressure of a particular gas is equal
  to the mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>partial pressure - mole fraction × total pressure</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    the sum of all partial pressures in a mixture is equal to the total
    pressure.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>reversible reaction</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/115.933e97b4.mp3" /> - a reaction that does not go to
  completion. Instead, a state of dynamic equilibrium is set up, with products reforming
  reactants at the same rate that reactants form products.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>yield</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/116.e1d61cb2.mp3" /> – the amount of a substance produced.
</p>
