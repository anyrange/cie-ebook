<p>
  <strong>catalyst</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/94.65360f43.mp3" /> - a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without itself being consumed by the reaction. It works by providing an alternative route with a lower activation energy, by which the reaction can take place.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>dynamic equilibrium </strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/95.530a4edd.mp3" /> – the stage in a reversible reaction when the rates of the forward and backward reactions are the same and the concentrations of the components of the mixture remain constant.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>equilibrium constant</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/96.fcc86f93.mp3" /> - a value for the ratio of concentration of products to reactants at equilibrium. It is constant at a specific temperature.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>K<sub>c</sub></strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/97.6416e283.mp3" /> – the equilibrium constant given in units of concentration. For the general reaction: aA + bB {'<->'} cC + dD <br/>K<sub>c</sub> is given, in terms of the equilibrium concentrations, by: K<sub>c</sub> = [C]<sup>c</sup>[D]<sup>d</sup> / [A]<sup>a</sup>[B]<sup>b</sup>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Le Chatelier’s principle</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/98.e53bc162.mp3" /> – a principle stating that if a factor affecting the position of an equilibrium is altered, the position of the equilibrium changes to oppose the effect of the change.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>mole fraction</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/99.fb7d6d92.mp3" /> – the mole fraction of a component is equal to the number of moles of the component in a mixture divided by the total number of moles. <br/>mole fraction of A = no. moles of A / total no. moles of all components.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>partial pressure</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/100.1a66be6b.mp3" /> – the pressure that a gas would exert if it were the only gas present. The partial pressure of a particular gas is equal to the mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>partial pressure</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/101.f86bd117.mp3" /> – the theory that particles in gases and liquids are in constant movement. The kinetic theory can be used to explain the effect of temperature and pressure on the volume of a gas as well as rates of chemical reactions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/102.bfc777ce.mp3" /> - the characteristic distribution of the energies of particles. Often plotted as a graph, called an energy distribution curve or Maxwell–Boltzmann curve, of energy against the number of particles in a sample with those energies.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>order of reaction</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/103.dcdcb6a9.mp3" /> - the power to which the concentration of a reactant is raised in the rate equation. If the concentration does not affect the rate, the reaction is zero order. If the rate is directly proportional to the reactant concentration, the reaction is first order. If the rate is directly proportional to the square of the reactant concentration.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>phase</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/104.669518c2.mp3" /> –  a region of a physical system with uniform chemical composition or physical properties. For example, ‘the gas phase’ indicates a region composed only of gas.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>rate constant</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/105.bc4e7f73.mp3" /> is the constant of proportionality in the rate equation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>rate of a reaction</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/106.97d44fbf.mp3" /> is the decrease in concentration of reactants per unit time, or the increase in concentration of products per unit time.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>transition state</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/107.1e907918.mp3" /> – a state through which a reaction passes between the reactants and the products. It is the state that has the highest energy, represented by the highest point on an enthalpy profile diagram or enthalpy level diagram.
