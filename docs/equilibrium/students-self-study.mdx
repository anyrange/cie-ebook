## Assignments:

<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong>
      1. Using example, develop tasks for one of the following videos: your
      video worksheet should have THREE PHASES:
    </strong>
    <em> pre-watching, while-watching</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>
      post-watching
    </em> <strong>exercises.</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <li>Le Chatelier’s Principle Part 1</li>
    <li>Le Chatelier’s Principle: Part 2</li>
    <li>The Haber Process</li>
  </dd>
</dl>

## Learning objectives:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.3.3.1 recall and be able to use ideas from previous teaching on
      equilibria, including the concept of dynamic equilibrium
    </td>
    <td>
      11.3.3.3 understand why a catalyst does not affect the position of
      equilibrium
    </td>
    <td>
      11.3.3.5 understand (with examples) why reaction conditions for industrial
      processes involving equilibria are often a compromise
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.3.3.2 be able to predict the effects change of temperature,
      concentration and pressure on equilibria
    </td>
    <td>
      11.3.3.4 understand the importance of equilibria in industrial chemistry
    </td>
    <td>
      11.3.3.6 be able to write the equilibrium constant (Kc) for a given
      reaction
      <br />
      11.3.3.7 be able to predict the effect of changing temperature on Kc and
      understand that Kc is not affected by changes in concentration or the
      addition of a catalyst
    </td>

#### 2. Develop one of the fragments of Lesson plan: you should use

<dl>
  <dd>
    <li>
      a lesson plan template (<strong>Appendix 1</strong>);
    </li>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <li>
      one of the CLIL techniques (<strong>Appendix 2</strong>);
    </li>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <li>teaching methods; and</li>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <li>learning objectives above.</li>
  </dd>
