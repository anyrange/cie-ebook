      1. Using example, develop tasks for one of the following videos: your
      video worksheet should have THREE PHASES:
    </strong>
    <em> pre-watching, while-watching</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>
      post-watching
    </em> <strong>exercises.</strong>

## Learning objectives:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.3.3.1 recall and be able to use ideas from previous teaching on
      equilibria, including the concept of dynamic equilibrium
    </td>
    <td>
      11.3.3.3 understand why a catalyst does not affect the position of
      equilibrium
    </td>
    <td>
      11.3.3.5 understand (with examples) why reaction conditions for industrial
      processes involving equilibria are often a compromise
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.3.3.2 be able to predict the effects change of temperature,
      concentration and pressure on equilibria
    </td>
    <td>
      11.3.3.4 understand the importance of equilibria in industrial chemistry
    </td>
    <td>
      11.3.3.6 be able to write the equilibrium constant (Kc) for a given
      reaction
      <br />
      11.3.3.7 be able to predict the effect of changing temperature on Kc and
      understand that Kc is not affected by changes in concentration or the
      addition of a catalyst
    </td>

#### 2. Develop one of the fragments of Lesson plan: you should use

- a lesson plan template [(**Appendix 1**)](../appendix/1);
- one of the CLIL techniques [(**Appendix 2**)](../appendix/2);
- teaching methods; and
- learning objectives above.
