### Assignments:

<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong>
      1. Using example, develop tasks for one of the following videos: your
      video worksheet should have THREE PHASES:
    </strong>
    <em> pre-watching, while-watching</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>
      post-watching
    </em> <strong>exercises.</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <li>Rates of Reaction - Part 2</li>
    <li>Rates of Reaction - Part 1</li>
    <li>Collision Theory & Reactions Part 1</li>
    <li>Collision Theory & Reactions - Part 2</li>
  </dd>
</dl>

### Learning objectives:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.3.2.1 recall and be able to apply the ideas from earlier work on the
      states of matter and simple collision theory
    </td>
    <td>
      11.3.2.5 understand that the rate of a chemical process can be represented
      by a rate equation
    </td>
    <td>11.3.2.9 know the meaning and definition of ‘catalyst’</td>

      a lesson plan template (<strong>Appendix 1</strong>);
    </li>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <li>
      one of the CLIL techniques (<strong>Appendix 2</strong>);
    </li>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <li>teaching methods; and</li>
