### Mnemonics

A mnemonic is a tool that helps us remember certain facts or large amounts of information. They can come in the form of a song, rhyme, acronym, image, phrase, or sentence. Mnemonics help us remember facts and are particularly useful when the order of things is important. For example, if students need to remember sequence of orbitals (s, p, d, f, g, h, I, k), they can be given as: Sober Physicists Donâ€™t Find Giraffes Hiding In Kitchens.6. Equilibrium
