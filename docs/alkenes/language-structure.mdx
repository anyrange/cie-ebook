## DEFINING RELATIVE CLAUSES

Relative clauses are used to define the noun and add extra information. There are relative pronouns that are used in these sentences: who, which, that, when, where and etc.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Defining Relative Clauses</th>
    <th>Non-defining Relative Clauses</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      We use defining relative clause to give necessary and essential
      information.
    </td>
    <td>
      We use non-defining relative clauses to give extra (additional)
      information.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <em>e.g.</em> Heterolytic fission is the breaking of a covalent
      bond <u>which</u> results in both electrons going to the same atom.
    </td>
    <td>
      <em>e.g.</em> An electrophile is a species,{' '}
      <u>which are positively charged</u>, can accept a pair of electrons from a
      species with a high electron density.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>!</strong> The information in a defining relative clause is
      essential, so we can’t leave out the relative clause.
    </td>
    <td>
      <strong>!</strong> The information in a non-defining relative clause is
      extra information which isn’t essential, so we can leave out the relative
      clause.
    </td>
  </tr>
