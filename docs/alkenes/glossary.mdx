## Glossary

<p>
  <strong>addition reaction</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/154.fc625b31.mp3' /> - a type of reaction in which two
  molecules combine to form a large molecule. At least one of the molecules must
  be unsaturated.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>addition polymerization</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/155.1c524242.mp3' /> – a type of polymerization in which
  unsaturated monomers (e.g. alkenes) undergo addition reactions with themselves
  to form polymers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>alkenes</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/156.144693d5.mp3' /> - a homologous series of unsaturated
  hydrocarbons with the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>alkyl group</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/157.1bcbcef6.mp3' /> – a homologous series of hydrocarbon
  molecules, with the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>bromine water</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/158.fc20f87f.mp3' /> – an aqueous solution of bromine
  that can be used to test for the presence of unsaturation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>carbocation</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/159.93c60da0.mp3' /> – an ion-containing a positively
  charged carbon atom. Carbocations are intermediates in electrophilic addition reactions
  of alkenes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>degree of polymerization</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/160.c9922939.mp3' /> – the number of monomers in a polymer,
  represented by the letter n. (Note that this ‘n’ is distinct from the ‘n’ used
  in a general formula).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electrophile</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/161.0e176e64.mp3' /> – a species that takes part in a
  reaction by accepting a lone pair of electrons from a nucleophile.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electrophilic addition</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/162.563ebb44.mp3' /> – an addition reaction in which an
  electrophile attacks a double bond and becomes bonded to one of the atoms that
  formed the double bond by a single covalent bond. One example is the formation
  of halogenoalkanes from alkenes, in which a halogen (X2) or hydrogen halide (HX)
  attacks a carbon–carbon double bond.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electrophilic addition reactions of alkenes</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/163.77fb58fe.mp3' /> - making halogenoalkanes, dihalogenoalkanes
  and alcohols.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>homologous series</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/164.308b679f.mp3' /> – a group of compounds that all have
  the same functional group but a different number of carbon atoms. Examples include
  alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, amines and halogenoalkanes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>hydration</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/165.84882a11.mp3' /> – the addition of water across a
  carbon–carbon double bond.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>hydrogenation</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/166.313a9cd4.mp3' /> – the addition of hydrogen across
  a carbon–carbon double bond.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>monomer</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/167.bf6b212b.mp3' /> – the repeating unit from which a
  polymer is made. For example, the monomer of polypropene is propene.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Markownikoff ’s rule</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/168.6a2d95b4.mp3' /> – the more electronegative part of
  the electrophile will usually attach itself to the more highly substituted carbon
  atom.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>pi bond</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/169.d5ba6dd1.mp3' /> – a covalent bond formed by the sideways
  overlap of atomic orbitals. It is involved in double bonds, and prevents rotation
  about the bond. Represented by the symbol π.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>polymerization</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/170.be9e4515.mp3' /> – the formation of a long chain molecule
  (polymer) consisting of many monomer molecules joined together.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>positional isomerism</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/171.04a47489.mp3' /> – a category of structural isomerism
  in which molecules have the same molecular formula but in which the functional
  group is attached to a different carbon atom. Alkenes with more than three carbon
  atoms can form positional isomers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>sigma bond</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/172.fc9c8ec4.mp3' /> – the strongest type of covalent
  bond, formed by the end-to-end overlap of atomic orbitals. Represented by the symbol
  σ.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>unsaturated</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/173.a6dd2b78.mp3' /> – a hydrocarbon, such as an alkene,
  that contains one or more carbon–carbon multiple bonds.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>unsymmetrical</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/174.aed21797.mp3' /> – an alkene (such as propene) in
  which the atoms or groups of atoms attached to opposite ends of the carbon–carbon
  double bond is not the same. This means that when they undergo addition reactions,
  unsymmetrical alkenes create a mix of different products.
