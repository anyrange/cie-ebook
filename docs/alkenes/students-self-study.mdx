## Assignments:

<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong>
      1. Using example, develop tasks for one of the following videos: your
      video worksheet should have THREE PHASES:
    </strong>
    <em> pre-watching, while-watching</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>
      post-watching
    </em> <strong>exercises.</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <li>
      <a href='https://youtu.be/nz1ucI6gCIg'>
        Polymerisation of propene & chloroethene
      </a>
    </li>
  </dd>

### Learning objectives:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.4.2.14 understand the term ‘unsaturation’ and its consequences for the
      compound
    </td>
    <td>
      11.4.2.17 understand the terms ‘electrophile’ and ‘nucleophile’ and be
      able to classify reagents
    </td>
    <td>11.4.2.20 know some industrially important addition reactions</td>
    <td>
      11.4.2.23 know the outline of manufacturing processes for (poly)alkenes
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>11.4.2.15 recall tests for unsaturation</td>
    <td>
      11.4.2.18 understand the mechanism of electrophilic addition, know some
      examples and be able to apply the mechanism to new cases
    </td>
    <td>11.4.2.21 understand addition polymerisation</td>
    <td>
      11.4.2.24 know some common uses of (poly)alkenes and understand the need
      for recycling
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.4.2.16 recognise the possibilities of geometric isomerism (‘E-Z’ or
      cis-trans isomerism) and recognise it as a type of stereoisomerism
    </td>
    <td>
      11.4.2.19 be able to predict the products of addition to unsymmetrical
      alkenes
    </td>
    <td>
      11.4.2.22 understand at a molecular level why addition polymers are
      relatively inert
    </td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>

#### 2. Develop one of the fragments of Lesson plan: you should use

- a lesson plan template [(**Appendix 1**)](../appendix/1);
- one of the CLIL techniques [(**Appendix 2**)](../appendix/2);
- teaching methods; and
- learning objectives above.
