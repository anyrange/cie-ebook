## The structure of an atom:

<p>
  <strong>atom</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/1.14349630.mp3" /> - the smallest component of an element
  having the chemical properties of the element
</p>
<p>
  <strong>atomic number</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/2.b287e710.mp3" /> – the number of protons found in the
  nucleus (that can be occupied by one or, at most, two electrons).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>atomic orbitals</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/3.60bb8da7.mp3" /> - regions of space outside the nucleus
  that can be occupied by one or, more electrons. They are named s, p, d, and f.
  They have different shapes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>anion</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/4.5ba47650.mp3" /> – negative ion which is formed by an
  electron gain.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>cation</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/9.39a3e638.mp3" /> – positive ion which is formed by electron
  loss.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electron</strong>

  and has a negative charge.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>element</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/13.26ec4101.mp3" /> – a substance made of only one type
  of atom.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>isotope</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/14.73dc5240.mp3" /> – any of two or more forms of a chemical
  element, atoms with the same atomic number but with different mass numbers, having
  the same number of protons in the nucleus but having different numbers of neutrons
  in the nucleus.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>ion</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/15.b9709024.mp3" /> - an electrically charged particle

  and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.
</p>
<p>

  has no charges and has the same mass as a proton.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>nucleus</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/21.e262d65e.mp3" /> – the central part of an atom that
  contains protons and nucleus.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>proton</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/22.27c66f56.mp3" /> – a positively charged subatomic particle
  in the nucleus.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>relative atomic mass</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/23.c97a109e.mp3" /> – the ration of the average mass of
  one atom of that element to 1/12th of the mass of one atom of carbon-12.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>relative molecular mass</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/24.03eda131.mp3" /> – the ratio of the average mass of
  that molecule to 1/12th of mass of an atom of carbon-12.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>atomic radius</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/5.2970333f.mp3" /> – half the shortest internuclear distance
  found in the structure of an element. Other values often used to represent the
  atomic radius are covalent radius, van der Waals radius and metallic radius.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>charge density</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/7.107d021b.mp3" /> – the charge-to-size ratio of an ion.
  Ions with greater charge-to-size ratio have more polarizing power.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>covalent radius</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/8.6c104229.mp3" /> – half the internuclear distance between
  two identical atoms in a single covalent bond. This is often used to represent
  the atomic radius of non-metallic elements.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>diatomic</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/10.47b1fc47.mp3" /> – an element, such as chlorine, which
  exists as molecules consisting of two atoms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>effective nuclear charge</strong>

  nucleus experienced by the outermost electrons, after taking shielding effects
  into account.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>metallic radius</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/17.b9555408.mp3" /> – half the shortest internuclear distance
  between two adjacent atoms in a metallic bond. This is often used to represent
  the atomic radius of metallic elements.

<p>
  <strong>molecular compound</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/18.83d476cb.mp3" /> – a substance containing molecules
  made up of covalently-bonded atoms. The molecules are held together by intermolecular
  forces. Also called simple covalent.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>monatomic</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/19.ac428d40.mp3" /> – An element, such as argon, which
  exists as single atoms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bohr’s model</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/6.26b3d039.mp3" /> – a concept or model of the atom in
  which the negatively charged electrons move in circular or elliptical orbits around
  the positively charged nucleus, energy being emitted or absorbed when electrons
  change from one orbit to another.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>in Thomson’s model</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/26.84da3ca2.mp3" /> ,the atom is composed of electrons
  surrounded by positive charge to balance the electrons’ negative charges, like
  negatively charged “plums” surrounded by positively charged “pudding”.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>the Rutherford model</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/25.810608ed.mp3" /> shows that an atom is mostly empty
  space, with electrons orbiting a fixed, positively charged nucleus in set, predictable
  paths.
</p>

## Electron shell of an atom:

<p>
  <strong>Aufbau principle</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/27.9599b76e.mp3" /> – electrons always fill the lowest
  energy orbitals first.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electron</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/28.8caa3cc5.mp3" /> – particle found outside the nucleus
  and has a negative charge.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>electronic configuration</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/29.bcba6391.mp3" /> – the arrangement of electrons in
  an atom.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Quantum Numbers</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/35.7dca5a36.mp3" /> – The four numbers that define each
  particular electron of an atom. The Principle Quantum Number (n) describes the
  electrons’ energy and distance from the nucleus. The Angular Momentum Quantum Number
  (l) describes the shape of the orbital in which the electron resides.
</p>

:::note the Magnetic Quantum Number
The Magnetic Quantum Number (m describes the orientation of the orbital in space. The Spin Quantum number describes whether the spin of the electron is positive or negative.
:::

<p>
  <strong>Hund’s rule</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/31.0eaecd8e.mp3" /> – electrons never pair up in the same
  orbital until all orbitals of the same energy are singly occupied, and all unpaired
  electrons have parallel spin.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>orbital</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/33.30a746d5.mp3" /> – It is the space around the nucleus
  in which the electron is found with a probability of 90%.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Pauli exclusion principle</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/34.52228daf.mp3" /> – only two electrons may occupy the
  same orbital, and they must do so with opposite spin.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>shielding</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/36.1aae12c7.mp3" /> – the ability of inner shells of electrons
  to reduce the effective nuclear charge on electrons in the outer shell.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>subshells</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/37.e7607e86.mp3" /> – regions within the principal quantum
  shells where electrons have more or less energy depending on their distance from
  the nucleus. They are given the letters s, p, d and f.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>first ionization energy</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/30.65f3209f.mp3" /> – the amount of energy required to
  remove the first electron from an atom. More accurately, it is the amount of energy
  required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous atoms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>mutual repulsion</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/32.39dbba8d.mp3" /> – repulsion between the two electrons
  paired within a single orbital.
</p>

:::note Note
(Note that this is mutual repulsion within an electron pair, as in the context of
explaining the low ionization energy of sulfur, not mutual repulsion between electron
pairs, as in the context of working out the shape of a molecule).

## Mass spectrometry:

<p>
  <strong>mass spectrum</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/41.5c328971.mp3" /> – a plot of the mass-to-charge ratio
  (m/z) of detected fragments against their relative abundance.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>molecular ion</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/42.9fc1d843.mp3" /> – the ion formed when a molecule loses
  an electron during mass spectrometry but does not fragment. Represented by the
  symbol M+.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>molecular ion peak</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/43.fb64677b.mp3" /> – The peak on the mass spectrum of
  a compound at the highest mass-to-charge ratio, which corresponds to the relative
  atomic mass of the molecular ion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>acceleration</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/38.5a5d4c60.mp3" /> – the stage of operation of the mass
  spectrometer when Ions accelerated to uniform speed by electric field.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>deflection</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/39.f77a5dc7.mp3" /> – the stage of operation of the mass
  spectrometer when Ions deflected by magnetic field; deflection depends on m/e ratio.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>detection</strong>
   - the stage of operation of the mass spectrometer when electric current measured
  as ions land on plate.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>mass spectrometer</strong>
