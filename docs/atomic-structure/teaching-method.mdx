#### HOW do you group students in the classroom?

#### Option 1: a teacher chooses

<li>grouping students according to patterns, colours, objects:</li>
<li>For example, group #1: Protons, group#2: Electrons and group #3: Neutrons</li>
<li><strong>grouping students according to students’ same skill level:</strong> students can have ability specific tasks. For example, group 1 creates digital model of something, while group 2 draws the model on the poster. </li>
<li><strong>grouping students according to mix skill level:</strong>students learn better from each other when their different levels and skills are mixed.</li>
<li><strong>grouping students according to interest: </strong> learn students’ interests via discussion or class survey, and group them accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>grouping students according to pre-assigned groups:</strong> if a teacher needs specific students to work together, they can be assigned earlier by giving cards with names.</li>
<li><strong>grouping students according to a day of the week:</strong> a student is assigned to a specific group or a partner for each day of the week. For example, on Wednesday, he/she gets together with her/his Wednesday group. </li>
<li><strong>grouping students according to their Contact lists:</strong> ask to students create their contact lists in copybooks (like in the phone) and a teacher tells: “today get with second contact”.</li>

#### Option 2: students choose

<li>students get into groups on their own.</li>
<li><strong>students get into groups on their own with a condition:</strong> a teacher can say: “Don’t join with a student you worked with the last lesson”. </li>
<li><strong>students are grouped according to their responses:</strong> a teacher asks a question or gives a quiz, and students join into groups according to how they think or scored.</li>
<li><strong>students are given options: </strong> they are told different groups and tasks types, and students choose themselves what they want to do.</li>
<li><strong>students are grouped by four corners ABCD:  </strong> A  – one corner of the classroom, B – the second corner, C – the third corner and D – the last corner.Each corner has its question, taskor a subtopic to study. </li>
