# Teaching method

## HOW do you group students in the classroom?

### Option 1: a teacher chooses

- grouping students according to patterns, colours, objects:
- For example, group #1: Protons, group#2: Electrons and group #3: Neutrons
- **grouping students according to students’ same skill level:** students can have ability specific tasks. For example, group 1 creates digital model of something, while group 2 draws the model on the poster.
- **grouping students according to mix skill level:**students learn better from each other when their different levels and skills are mixed.
- **grouping students according to interest: ** learn students’ interests via discussion or class survey, and group them accordingly.
- **grouping students according to pre-assigned groups:** if a teacher needs specific students to work together, they can be assigned earlier by giving cards with names.
- **grouping students according to a day of the week:** a student is assigned to a specific group or a partner for each day of the week. For example, on Wednesday, he/she gets together with her/his Wednesday group.
- **grouping students according to their Contact lists:** ask to students create their contact lists in copybooks (like in the phone) and a teacher tells: “today get with second contact”.

### Option 2: students choose

- students get into groups on their own.
- **students get into groups on their own with a condition:** a teacher can say: “Don’t join with a student you worked with the last lesson”.
- **students are grouped according to their responses:** a teacher asks a question or gives a quiz, and students join into groups according to how they think or scored.
- **students are given options: ** they are told different groups and tasks types, and students choose themselves what they want to do.
- **students are grouped by four corners ABCD: ** A – one corner of the classroom, B – the second corner, C – the third corner and D – the last corner.Each corner has its question, taskor a subtopic to study.
