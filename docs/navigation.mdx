## Title
The topic of the unit

## Classroom language
They are useful phrases, organized by topics, used for classroom management. They are voiced by an English teacher for an improved pronunciation.

## Language structure
These are the main meaningful elements of the English language that are commonly used in Chemistry. Together with rules on how to use them, they can be learned through chemical examples, which makes it easier for chemistry teachers to understand and use.

## Vocabulary practice tips
Each unit describes one of the techniques used to practice a language (vocabulary, speaking, writing) with students. 

## Glossary
Each unit consists of an alphabetic list of terms with definitions. These are topic-specific keywords that are newly introduced in the reading. They are then practiced throughout the whole unit, which makes their learning and memorization more effectively. All the words and definitions are voiced and recorded by a native speaker

## Reading & Practice exercises

### Reading
This section covers the topic of the unit through explaining main concepts. All the reading passages are voiced by the native speaker in order to bring language learning closer to an authentic environment. 

### Practice exercises
Following the reading, students can do practical exercises.

## Video lesson
Each unit offers one video lesson for the topic, which has a logical set of exercises: “before you watch”, while you watch” and “after you watch”. 
This is an authentic video material enabling students to revise both the content and language. 

## Bloom Taxonomy
Much attention is paid to the development of such an essential skill as the ability to formulate questions of different levels using Bloom's taxonomy. At the end of each topic, 6 types of questions are provided: from lower-order thinking to higher-order thinking questions.

## Students's self-study section
This section is aimed at developing students’ methodological skills. Future teachers are asked to complete two assignments: developing a video lesson and a lesson plan fragment using offered lesson objectives, teaching methods and techniques.  

## Teaching methods 
Each unit offers one student-centered teaching method that can be applied in practice by future teachers.
