#### Blended learning
Blended learning is a mix of learning online and face-to-face learning spaces and experiences.
<li>Station Rotation Blended Learning</li>
Station-Rotation blended learning is a: “...model (that) allows students to rotate through stations on a fixed schedule, where at least one of the stations is an online learning station. This model is most common in elementary schools because teachers are already familiar with rotating in centers and stations.<br/>

<li>The ‘Flipped Classroom’ Blended Learning</li>
Perhaps the most widely known version of blended learning, a ‘Flipped Classroom’ is one where students are introduced to content at home, and practice working through it at school supported by a teacher and/or peers. In this way, traditional roles for each space are ‘flipped.’<br/>
<li>Individual Rotation Blended Learning</li>
The Individual Rotation model allows students to rotate through stations, but on individual schedules set by a teacher or software algorithm. Unlike other rotation models, students do not necessarily rotate to every station; they rotate only to the activities scheduled on their playlists.”<br/>
<li>Outside-In Blended Learning</li>
In Outside-In blended learning, experiences are planned to ‘start’ in the non-academic physical and digital environments students use on a daily basis, but finish inside a classroom.<br/>
<li>Supplemental Blended Learning</li>
In this model, students complete either entirely online work to supplement their day-to-day face-to-face learning, or entirely face-to-face learning experiences to supplement the learning gained in online courses and activities.<br/>
The big idea here is supplementing—critical learning objectives are met entirely in one space while the ‘opposite’ space provides the student with specific supplementing experiences that the other did not or could not provide.<br/>
