<p>
  <strong>bond energy</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3" /> - the energy needed to break onemole of a given bond in a gaseous molecule. 
  a base.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>co-ordinate bond (or dative covalent bond)</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/49.6ef951bf.mp3" /> – a covalent bond in which both electrons in the bond come from the same atom.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>covalent bond</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/50.6cb21bad.mp3" /> - a bond formed by the sharing of pairs ofelectrons between two atoms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>delocalised electrons</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/57.42319403.mp3" /> – electrons that are not associated with any one particular atom or bond.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>dipole–dipole forces</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/51.31409724.mp3" /> – the forces between two molecules having permanent dipoles.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>dot-and-cross diagram</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/52.48186f17.mp3" /> – a diagram showing the arrangement of the outer-shell electrons in an ionic or covalent element or compound.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>intermolecular forces</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/58.47558f5c.mp3" /> – the weak forces between molecules.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>ionic bond</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/59.b5c19e7f.mp3" /> – the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>hybridization</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/60.01e4d991.mp3" /> - the process of mixing atomic orbitals so that each has some character of each of the orbitals mixed.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>hydrogen bonding </strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/61.5e962a1f.mp3" /> - the strongest type of intermolecular force. It is formed between molecules having a hydrogen atom bonded to one of the most electronegative elements (F, O or N).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>lone pairs (of electrons)</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/45.76489fdf.mp3" /> – pairs of electrons in the outer shell of an atom that are not bonded.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>metallic bonding</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/46.37c18946.mp3" /> – the strong attractive forces (bond) between the positively charged ions and the delocalized electrons.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>pi (π) bonds</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/47.2323b334.mp3" /> – multiple covalent bonds involving thesideways overlap of p atomic orbitals.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>sigma (σ) bonds</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/48.175501fe.mp3" /> – single covalent bonds formed by the overlap of atomic orbitals.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>spin-pair repulsion</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/53.69493ae8.mp3" /> – electrons repel each other as they have the same charge. Electrons arrange themselves so that they first singly occupy different orbitals in the same sublevel.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>van der Waals’ forces</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/54.7d521dcf.mp3" /> – very weak forces of attraction between all atoms or molecules.
