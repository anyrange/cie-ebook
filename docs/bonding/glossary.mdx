<p>
  <strong>bond energy</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/62.6b867473.mp3" /> - the energy needed to break onemole of a given bond in a gaseous molecule. 
  a base.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>co-ordinate bond (or dative covalent bond)</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/63.ff042798.mp3" /> – a covalent bond in which both electrons in the bond come from the same atom.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>covalent bond</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/64.89954986.mp3" /> - a bond formed by the sharing of pairs ofelectrons between two atoms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>delocalised electrons</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/65.bd08537e.mp3" /> – electrons that are not associated with any one particular atom or bond.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>dipole–dipole forces</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/66.20712d15.mp3" /> – the forces between two molecules having permanent dipoles.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>dot-and-cross diagram</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/67.17c62ec5.mp3" /> – a diagram showing the arrangement of the outer-shell electrons in an ionic or covalent element or compound.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>intermolecular forces</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/70.1890a5a1.mp3" /> – the weak forces between molecules.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>ionic bond</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/71.e801d54a.mp3" /> – the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>hybridization</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/68.3f134a65.mp3" /> - the process of mixing atomic orbitals so that each has some character of each of the orbitals mixed.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>hydrogen bonding </strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/69.ae63968b.mp3" /> - the strongest type of intermolecular force. It is formed between molecules having a hydrogen atom bonded to one of the most electronegative elements (F, O or N).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>lone pairs (of electrons)</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/72.1de68a9b.mp3" /> – pairs of electrons in the outer shell of an atom that are not bonded.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>metallic bonding</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/73.5cbf687c.mp3" /> – the strong attractive forces (bond) between the positively charged ions and the delocalized electrons.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>pi (π) bonds</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/74.405e9dd8.mp3" /> – multiple covalent bonds involving thesideways overlap of p atomic orbitals.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>sigma (σ) bonds</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/75.80ffbf9d.mp3" /> – single covalent bonds formed by the overlap of atomic orbitals.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>spin-pair repulsion</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/76.9678efcb.mp3" /> – electrons repel each other as they have the same charge. Electrons arrange themselves so that they first singly occupy different orbitals in the same sublevel.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>van der Waals’ forces</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/77.ea33b295.mp3" /> – very weak forces of attraction between all atoms or molecules.
