### üíø ‚ÄúChemical bonding ‚Äì Ionic vs. Covalent Bonds‚Äù

‚ùï _This is an authentic video. Do not try to understand every word you hear. Watch and listen for general and specific information by completing the following tasks._

### Before you watch:

**Exercise 1. Explain the meaning of these words and phrases, that you meet in the video. How do you think they refer to the topic and video? Give reasons.**

_octet rule ‚Äì outer shell ‚Äì atom ‚Äì chemically stable ‚Äì electrons_

### While you watch:

**Watch the first part of the video (till 00:30) and check your guesses from Exercise 1.**

**Exercise 3. Watch the next part of the video (00:31-1:10) about a covalent bond and match the beginning of a sentence with its ending.**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>A covalent bond is formed when</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>
      carbon can share with other atoms, and thereby have a completed outer
      shell.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Carbon atom holds four electrons in its outer shell</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>atoms share electrons in order to satisfy the octet rule</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>In order to gain additional four electrons,</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>carbon achieves octet of electrons.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>
      If one carbon and four hydrogen atoms come together and share their
      electrons,
    </td>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>but it would be much more stable with eight.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Note that each hydrogen in this compound</td>
    <td>E</td>
    <td>achieves two electrons in its outer shell.</td>
  </tr>

**Exercise 4. Watch the next part of the video (1:11-till the end) about an ionic bond and complete the gaps.**

### After you watch:

**Exercise 5. Explain the formation of ionic and covalent bonding in the following combinations: sulfuric acid, magnesium oxide, copper (II) sulfate.**
