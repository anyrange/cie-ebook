        the teacher. This gives them some time to think for themselves. Next, in
        pairs, learners compare and discuss their answers with each other.
        Finally, have a short plenary discussion of some of the groups‚Äô answers.

    <tr>

       Think of a ‚Äòsentence stem‚Äô which can be completed in various ways related to an aspect of your topic. Write the stem on a worksheet or the board ten times. Use a sentence stem that learners can easily complete; nothing too difficult. For example:
        <br/>Shakespeare....<br/>Shakespeare....<br/>Shakespeare.... (etc.)
