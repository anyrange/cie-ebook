        the teacher. This gives them some time to think for themselves. Next, in
        pairs, learners compare and discuss their answers with each other.

        <br />
        <strong>Introduction to How SMS Works </strong>
        <br />
        ust when we‚Äôre finally used to seeing everybody constantly talking on
        their 1 ______ __________ it suddenly seems like no one is talking at
        all. Instead, they‚Äôre typing away on tiny numerical pads, using their 1
        ________________ to send quick messages. SMS, or 2 ________________, has
        replaced talking on the phone for a new ‚Äúthumb generation‚Äù of texters.
        <br />
        In this article, we‚Äôll find out how text messaging works, explore its
        uses and learn why it sometimes takes a while for your 2
        ________________ to get to its recipient.
        <br />
        SMS stands for 3 ________________. Simply put, it is a method of
        communication that sends text between 1 ________________, or from a PC
        or handheld to a cell phone. The ‚Äúshort‚Äù part refers to the maximum size
        of the text messages: 160 4 ________________ (letters, numbers or
        symbols in the Latin alphabet). For other alphabets, such as Chinese,
        the maximum SMS size is 70.
        <br />4 ________________.
        <br />
        But how do 5 ________________ messages actually get to your phone? [...]
        Even if you are not talking on your cell phone, your phone is constantly
        6 ________________ and 7 ________________.information. It is talking to its
        cell phone tower over a pathway called a 8 ________________. The reason for
        this chatter is so that the 9 ________________ system knows which cell your
        phone is in, and so that your phone can change 10 ________________ as you
        move around. Every so often, your phone and the tower will exchange.
        <br />a packet of data that lets both of them know that everything is
        OK.

        Even though we don‚Äôt see them, water molecules are in the air all around

        ____________________ around in the atmosphere, they don‚Äôt normally stick

        <br />
        Squeezing the sides of the bottle forces the molecules to squeeze
        together or 3 _____ _______________. Releasing the pressure allows the
        air to 4 ____________________, and in doing so, the temperature of the
        air becomes cooler. This cooling process allows the molecules to stick
        together more easily forming tiny 5 ____________________ and clouds are
        nothing more than tiny water 5 ____________________. The smoke in the
        bottle also helps this process. Water particles will group together more
        easily if there are some solid particles in the air to act as a 6
        ____________________. The invisible particles serve as the 6 and help in
        the formation of the cloud. Clouds on Earth form when warm air rises and
        its pressure is reduced. The air 7 ____________________ and cools, and
        clouds form as the temperature drops below the 8 ____________________
        point. The invisible particles in the air may be in the form of
        pollution, smoke, dust or even tiny particles of dirt.

      <strong>Biology: blood vessels </strong>
      <br />
      This activity is useful for topics where sub-topics have three or four
      different characteristics. Use it at the end of a topic to revise what
      learners have learned.
      <br />
      1. Make a table containing your chosen topics and their characteristics.
      <br />
      2. Copy the table you have created onto different pieces of coloured
      cardboard, one colour for each group of learners. Cut out the cards and
      shuffle them.
      <br />
      3. Learners form groups of four. Each group is given a pile of shuffled
      cards (of a single colour). Tell them they have 10 minutes to arrange the
      cards into three logical columns on their table.
      <br />
      4. You circulate, asking critical questions and giving hints about the
      choices learners have made.
      <br />
      5. Learners should be encouraged to use English only and to explain to
      each other why they think a card belongs in a certain column.
      <br />
      6. After 10 minutes, the groups rotate. Each group moves to another table
      and has another 5 minutes to correct or reorganise the work of another
      group.
      <br />
      7. The groups return to their original table and try to discover the
      changes the other group made to their work. They reorganise the columns
      again, depending on whether they agree or disagree with the new order.
      <br />
      8. If learners get stuck, you can scaffold learning by providing a short
      text about the three topics. <br />
      9. Discuss the correct answers with the whole class or with individual groups.{' '}
      <br />
      10. The columns can be arranged to produce a table of properties (for
      example, of the three types of blood vessels) that can be copied into
      notebooks for revision.
      <br />
      <strong>Arteries: </strong>carry blood away from heart; blood at high
      pressure; no valves; thick muscular walls; no substances leave or enter
      vessel; pulse created by heart pumping & contraction of wall muscle;
      strong walls; carry oxygenated blood (with one exception)
      <br />
      <strong>Capillaries: </strong>carry blood through tissues and organs;
      blood at low pressure; no valves; very thin walls for escape of fluids;
      exchange of substances with tissues; no pulse; walls delicate and easily
      broken; carry mix of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood
      <br />
      <strong>Veins: </strong>carry blood towards heart; blood at lowest
      pressure; valves to stop blood flowing back; thinner walls with less
      muscle; no substances leave or enter vessel; no pulse; walls flexible &
      squashed easily so blood pushed further along vessel; carry deoxygenated
      blood (with one exception).

      <strong>Subject (biology) words: </strong>bloodstream, blood sugar level, cell,
      endocrine, glucose, homeostasis, hormones, pancreas, insulin, sugar molecule,

      It is possible to add a second step to this activity to emphasise the
      difference between academic and everyday language: ask learners to think
      of synonym pairs (quick - rapid; release - let go).

      Unlike many cell phones, smartphones allow users to install, configure and
      run applications of their choosing. A smartphone offers the ability to
      conform the device to your particular way of doing things. Most standard
      cell-phone software offers only limited choices for re-configuration,
      forcing you to adapt to the way it‚Äôs set up. On a standard phone, whether
      or not you like the built-in calendar application, you are stuck with it
      except fora few tweaks. If that phone were a smartphone, you could install
      any compatible calendar application you like. <br />

      <strong>Physics: lab reports </strong>
      <br />
      The language of laboratory reports, which uses a lot of passive forms, is
      sometimes difficult for CLIL learners. This noticing task guides them to
      look at the passive tenses in an authentic laboratory report.
      <br />
      <strong>Instructions </strong>
      <br />
      Laboratory reports are often written in the passive tense (e.g.{' '}
      <em>The test tube</em> was filled, <em>The liquid was</em> measured out),
      to make them more formal and less personal. You can recognise
      passive-voice expressions because the verb phrase always includes a form
      of <em>be</em>, such as <em>am, is, was, were, are,</em> or <em>been</em>.
      However, the presence of a form of <em>be</em> does not necessarily mean
      that the sentence is in the passive voice. You can also recognise
      passive-voice sentences since they often include a ‚Äòby the...‚Äô phrase
      after the verb, for example <em>The man was bitten by the dog</em>).
      <br />
      Here is a part of a real laboratory report. Underline all the examples of
      the passive tense in the text. How many are there?

      <strong>Procedure </strong>
      <br />
      The spring we tested was a coil spring from the rear suspension of a 1968 Volvo
      sedan (model 142s). It was a left-hand helical compression spring, had open
      ground ends, and <u>was made of</u> steel. The dimensions of the unloaded spring,
      the outside diameter, the total number of coils of turns and the wire diameter{' '}
      <u>are listed</u> in Table 1. Using these dimensions, the spring‚Äôs fully compressed
      length (solid height) <u>was estimated</u> to be xx cm, or -xx% of its free
      length. This estimate <u>was based</u> on the following equation [...] where{' '}
      <strong>NT</strong> is the total number of coils, <strong>L0</strong> its free
      length and <strong>d</strong> is the diameter of the wire. This value <u>
        was used
      </u> to specify the maximum compression which <u>was used</u> in the test.
      Setting this value at xx%, an estimate of the forces that would be generated{' '}
      <u>was also made</u> using the following equation where x is the deflection
      of the spring, <strong>N=L0/NT</strong> is the number of active coils, <strong>
        D
      </strong> is the mean coil diameter and <strong>G</strong> is the shear modulus
      for the spring material.

      This activity works well for a revision lesson or at the end of a series

      <br />
      <strong>Individual work </strong>
      <br />
      Learners or the teacher first write down ideas, concepts or facts about
      the topic individually; each of these must be written on a different card.
      Learners then mix up their sets of cards and spread them on the table face
      down. They then select two cards at random and discuss{' '}
      <em>which is the most important</em>. They put this one on the left.
      Learners then take a third card and compare it with the card on the right,
      asking the question Which of the two is more important? They place it on
      the appropriate side and continue until their cards are used up, thus
      creating a row of cards with the most important idea on the left, and the
      least important idea on the right. <br />
      <strong>Pair work </strong>

      This is an example (based on Walsh, 2004) of learners becoming experts on
      one part of the course book unit about the Reformation. The teacher
      divided the unit into sections and the class into groups. Each group was
      given different questions to answer or tasks to do:
      <br />
      <strong>Group 1: </strong>pages 30 and 31: ‚ÄòMedieval reformers‚Äô
      <br />
      Make a list of concerns about the Roman Catholic Church during the Middle
      Ages. What made the spreading of new ideas about the Church easier?

      Make a list of the events which happened between the time of Pope Leo X
      and Luther.Make a list of events which happened between the time of
      Emperor Charles V and Luther.

      Why did the ruler of Saxony support Luther?
      <br />
      Which role did propaganda play in the struggle between the Pope and the
      Emperor on one side and Luther on the other side?
      <br />
      <strong>Group 3: </strong>pages 36 and 37: ‚ÄòThe Protestant Reformation:
      Europe divides‚Äô
      <br />
      Look at the map on page 37: To which country did the Netherlands belong?
      What was the main religion in the Netherlands?
      <br />
      What can you say about the size of the Netherlands during the 16th
      century? <br />
      <strong>Group 4: </strong>page 36: ‚ÄòProtestant Europe‚Äô
      <br />
      Who were more attracted to Protestant ideas?
      <br />
      Why were they more attracted to these ideas?
      <br />
      Make a table in which you give information about the two groups of Protestants:
      Lutherans and Calvinists.
      <br />
      <strong>Group 5: </strong>pages 38-39: ‚ÄòThe Pope strikes back: The Catholic

      What was the consequence of the Council of Trent? <br />
      After they had answered the questions in groups, the groups exchanged information.
      Then, five new groups were formed, each containing one expert on a different

      Learners imagine they are in a hot air balloon which is losing helium and
      height and will soon crash because it is too heavy. Each passenger has an
      opportunity to make a speech outlining the reasons why s/he should be
      allowed to remain in the balloon. The audience decides which of the
      speakers has presented their case most persuasively.
      <br /> Divide the class into a number of teams, each representing one passenger
      in the rapidly descend- ing balloon. In these groups, the learners prepare
      to present their case about why they should stay in the hot air balloon. They
      can write short notes to help them remember what to say, but the speech should
      sound as spontaneous as possible. This preparation stage can also be given
      as homework.
      <br />
      Once the preparation has been completed, to ensure that everyone in the group
      contributes, randomly appoint the first contestants to give the speech from
      each group. You may want to provide learners with a scaffold or some questions
      to help them to prepare their speeches.
      <br />
      You could also give learners guidelines for structuring the presentation of
      their arguments, such as:
      <dl>
        <dd>
          <ul type='disc'>
            <li>a maximum of three minutes; </li>
            <li>begin with an opening statement; </li>
            <li>illustrate with examples; </li>
            <li>prepare at least three convincing arguments; </li>
            <li>end with a challenging closing statement.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      You can also provide helpful words and phrases for giving opinions in a formal
      speech.
      <br />
      After each group‚Äôs first speech, the class votes for the two most convincing
      characters. Learners are not allowed to vote for their own group! The two remaining
      survivors give a new speech, summing up the crucial reasons, and trying to
      add new ones, for their continued survival. Finally the class votes for the
      last remaining survivor.

      <strong>Variation: Chain debate </strong>
      <br />
      <strong>Preparation </strong>
      <br />
      The teacher makes two smaller groups, Group 1 and Group 2. The teacher
      writes down a controver- sial statement. Group 1 must agree with the
      statement and Group 2 disagree. The rest of the class are members of the
      jury who will decide which learner has used the most convincing arguments
      and thus wins the chain debate.
      <br />
      The two groups first prepare a number of arguments for (Group 1) or
      against (Group 2) the statement. They will need the same number of
      arguments as there are people in their group: every learner argues a
      single point during the debate.

          2. Speakers from each group take turns. Speaker A from Group 1 starts

          this and adds a second argument from Group 1.

      To find out the answer to this question, the learners walk around the classroom.

      as possible.
      <br />
      In the follow-up plenary, the class has a new task: the learners who were Elizabeth
      place the other characters into two groups: allies or enemies. Then the Elizabeths

      <strong>Biology: Human organs </strong>
      <br />
      The government has announced plans to economise on the costs of human
      bodies. The most striking measure is the plan to abolish at least one
      entire organ system. However, there is still no consensus among government
      officials which organ system should be done away with. According to
      reliable sources, more details will be announced next month.
      <br />
      The different organisations for organ systems have been asked for input
      and comment. The following seven institutes were approached:
      <ul type='disc'>
        <li>the Association of Circulatory Systems (ACS); </li>
        <li>the Royal Club of Respiratory Systems (RCRS);</li>
        <li>the Friends of Excretions (FE); </li>
        <li>the Digestive Society (DS); </li>
        <li>the Endocrine System Interest Group (ESIG); </li>
        <li>the Nervous Ones (NO); </li>
        <li>the Propagators of Reproduction (PR). </li>
      </ul>
      The above-mentioned interest groups have expressed their concern about the
      situation, but are not willing to comment at this stage. All agree that
      talks should be held with each party concerned before opinions can be
      expressed, and that society should not be rushed into taking such
      far-reaching measures.
      <br />
      The following procedure has been proposed. Each of the organisations will
      send representatives to argue their case to keep their particular organ
      system. The talks which will be held at school. There will be simultaneous
      meetings, each with one representative of each interest group.
      <br />
      The outcomes will be discussed in a plenary session. Hopefully, a
      government official will be present to witness the possible consequences
      of their proposed policies.

      <strong>Group A</strong> - What is the Rosetta Stone?
      <br />
      The Rosetta Stone is a stone with writing on it in two languages (1
      ____________________ + 2 ____________________), using three scripts
      (Hieroglyphics, Demotic and Greek). The Rosetta Stone is written in three
      scripts because when it was written, there were three scripts being used
      in Egypt. The first was Hieroglyphics, which was the script used for 3
      ____________________ documents. The second was Demotic, which was the 4
      ____________________ of Egypt. The third was Greek, which was the 5
      ____________________ at that time. The Rosetta Stone was written in all
      three scripts so that the priests, government officials and rulers of
      Egypt could read what it said. The Rosetta Stone was carved in 6
      ____________________. The Rosetta Stone was found in a small village in
      the Delta called 7 ____________________ in 1799 by French soldiers who
      were rebuilding a fort in Egypt. It is called the Rosetta Stone because it
      was discovered in a town called 8 ____________________.
      <br />
      <strong>Group B</strong> - What is the Rosetta Stone?
      <br />
      The Rosetta Stone is a stone with writing on it in two languages (Egyptian
      and Greek), using three scripts (1___________________ +
      2___________________ + 3___________________). The Rosetta Stone is written
      in three scripts because when it was written, there were three scripts
      being used in Egypt. The first was 4___________________, which was the
      script, which was the common script of Egypt. The third was 6
      ___________________, which was the language of the rulers of Egypt at that
      used for important or religious documents. The second was 5
      ___________________ time. The Rosetta Stone was written in all three
      scripts so that the priests, government officials and rulers of Egypt
      could read what it said. The Rosetta Stone was carved in 196 B.C. The
      Rosetta Stone was found in a small village in the Delta called Rosetta in
      7 ___________________ by 8 ___________________ who were rebuilding a fort
      in Egypt. It is called the Rosetta Stone because it was discovered in a

      <br />
      1. Plan your story by answering these questions.
      <ul type='disc'>
        <li>
          Decide on a name for your pebble. Think about what sort of pebble you
          are going to write about. How big is it? What shape is it? What type
          of rock is it made of?
        </li>
        <li>
          Your pebble has been weathered from the side of a mountain. What
          mountain range does it come from? What sort of weathering has made
          your pebble? How does this type of weathering work? How did your
          pebble get into the river? What river is your pebble in?
        </li>
        <li>
          Your pebble is being transported along the whole length of the river.
          How does the river change as the pebble moves along? Does the river
          change name? How does the pebble change as it moves along the river?
          What sorts of things happen to the pebble as it moves along?
        </li>
        <li>
          Your pebble is eventually transported to a resting place. Where is it
          at the end of the story; a delta, the sea? What does your pebble look
          like now? What is the name of the place where your pebble is?
        </li>
      </ul>
      2. Now plan the plot of your story. Include as many of the new
      geographical words as you can in your story. Keep your textbook open when
      you plan and write the story. Make sure you tell the children what these
      difficult words mean. Plan what sketches, drawings or pictures you would
      like to use to illustrate your story. <br />
      3. Write a rough draft of your story in your notebook and edit it. If you work
      on the computer, always print out your work and bring it to class. If you do
      not do so, you will be wasting your class time.
      <br />
      4. Hand in a final copy including the sketches, drawings or pictures.

      Learners listen to an audio text about a topic. They eventually need to
      reconstruct the text in as much detail as possible. In doing so, learners
      practise listening, writing and speaking, and use vocabulary and grammar
      to complete the task. The learners listen to your chosen text, read along
      at normal speed, and write down key words. Then, in groups of three or
      four, they work closely together to share, compare and discuss their
      individual notes and co-operate to reconstruct the text in as much detail

      1. Using a course book or the Internet, find a short text on the Aztecs of

          1) In 1519, Hernan Cortez set foot upon that part of Central America
          that is today known as Mexico.

        <li>2) He expected to find gold, and he did. </li>

          3) What he did not expect to find, however, was the great Aztec
          civilisation.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          4) The Aztecs were in many ways more advanced than the Europeans, but
          nonetheless they were conquered by Cortez and his men.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          5) Originating in the plains of Aztlan in north-western Mexico,
          according to their own legends, the Aztecs slowly migrated southward.{' '}

      2. Dictation: Read the text at a speed a little bit slower than native
      speaker speed. Read the text again at native speaker speed; learners
      individually make very brief notes about the main ideas. The purpose is to
      get the main ideas, not every word exactly as it appears in the text, so
      do not read too slowly.
      <br />
      3. Reconstruction: The learners work in pairs and then fours to compare
      notes and write a shared version of the text, editing for accurate
      punctuation, spelling and inclusion of the main ideas. <br />
      4. Analysis and correction: The learners compare reconstructions with other
      groups and with the original. Discuss the differences.

      Through various forms of input, such as video, images, texts, and worksheets,
      the learners are given background information on the traditional Alpine environment
      and lifestyle. When they have a significant amount of information, they are
      told to choose six geographical themes and to write six information boxes (one
      for each theme) about the first picture. For example
      <ul type='none'>

        <li>5. farming habits </li>

      The learners develop the picture and add more details. This is repeated for
      the other two pictures. However, the learners are given fewer details per picture,
      so that they have to use their imagination a bit more to be able to fill in
      the six information boxes. In the second and third pictures, they must also
      illustrate the various themes they have chosen to develop (e.g., draw roads
      or an apartment building).

      The aim of this exercise is to identify the materials from which the
      objects have been made and to make a new table to replace the damaged one.
      To perform the investigation you will need to make density measurements of
      the objects. Density measurements can be obtained by measuring an object‚Äôs
      volume and mass. You will have to make some choices, such as what
      equipment to use and what formulae you might need. Choose wisely ‚Äì your
      decisions will affect how accurate you can be and how precisely you can
      identify the materials! Different objects may require different solutions,
      so don‚Äôt be afraid to make new choices each time. <br />
      Carry out appropriate measurements to find density and record the results in
      a new table. Describe your methods in your notebook. Perform more measurements
      to check for floating, magnetism and electric current. Fill in the table. The
      data you collected will not be enough to identify the composition of the objects.
      For this, you will have to compare your values with those from a reliable source.
      Data from such a source will be displayed in the classroom. How do your values
      compare with the benchmark? How sure can you be about your identifications?
      <br />
      With your partner, write a report. In it, describe how you carried out the
      investigation and try give valid reasons for choosing your methods. Include
      a completed results table identifying the objects. You can work together, but
      you must hand in one report each. Give yourselves a score (out of 10) indicating
      how confident you are of the identifications. Explain why you give yourself
      the score you do!

      <strong>Preparation </strong>
      <br />
      You will need a copy of an assignment or project for your learners on
      paper and an empty rubric (see Example 32 and 33). <br />
      1. Discuss the assignment or project. Work with a colleague or colleagues (subject
      and language teachers) or learners, to clarify subject and language aims.
      <br />
      2. Brainstorm together to produce a first version of the assessment criteria.
      Accept all ideas at this stage. For example, here are some brainstormed criteria
      for a history presentation to a German commandant on how the use of gas in
      the First World War can be justified:
      <br />
      <strong>Possible subject criteria </strong>
      <br />
      Clear introduction
      <br />
      Accurate information (dates, events)
      <br />
      Complete information on how gas was used and by whom
      <br />
      Reasons why the use of gas can be justified
      <br />
      Reasons why its use cannot be justified
      <br />
      Clear conclusion ...
      <br />
      <strong>Possible language criteria for speaking</strong>
      <br />
      Pronunciation, intonation, word stress, grammatical accuracy grammatical range,
      vocabulary range, use of linking words, fluency, use of language of persuasion,
      ...
      <br />
      <strong>Possible presentation criteria</strong>
      <br />
      Attention-grabbing start
      <br />
      Visuals support points
      <br />
      Visuals support points
      <br />
      Eye contact
      <br />
      Body language
      <br />
      Audience awareness
      <br />
      Amount of text on PowerPoint slides...
      <br />
      3. From the brainstorm, select five to eight criteria, so that the rubric fits
      on one page. Write them in the left-hand column.
      <br />
      4. Write <em>descriptors</em> (short descriptions) in the boxes. Start with
      column 4, the best achievement, and work backwards. Be as specific and positive
      as possible: write what IS true as far as possible, rather than what is not.
      A useful technique for writing descriptors is to use the phrases 4. <em>
        yes ;
      </em> 3. <em>yes, but;</em> 2.<em> no, but;</em> 1. <em>no</em> while writing
      each category. For example if the criterion is <em>
        species information:
      </em>
      <br />
      level 4: <em>Yes</em>, species information is complete and correct
      <br />
      level 3: <em>Yes</em>, the species information is correct, <em>but</em> it
      is not complete <br />
      level 2: <em>No</em>, the species information is not all correct,{' '}
      <em>but</em> some of it is <br />
      level 1: <em>No</em>, the species information is not correct at all
      <br />
      5. Share the first draft with other colleagues or another group of learners
      and ask them to give feedback on its clarity. You could also try assessing
      some assignments with it, if available.
      <br />
      Discuss how clear and useful the criteria are. <br />
      6. Revise and improve the rubric. Make any changes you feel are necessary
      based on the feedback and your own experiences in the try-out.

  <tr>
    <td>
      This is an activity for dividing your class into groups that takes into
      account the learners‚Äô preferences but which produces groups in a fair way.
      It is worth taking time to divide the class into groups carefully, since
      group organisation influences the results of the project.
      <br />
      1. Explain to your class that they are going to do some project work in a
      few weeks‚Äô time and that you would like to divide them into groups fairly.
      Discuss aspects of groupings with them, such as:
      <ul type='disc'>
        <li>Who would you like to work with and why? </li>
        <li>Who do you work well with (not just friends)? </li>
        <li>How do you choose who to work with? </li>
        <li>Who has skills or qualities which you don‚Äôt have? </li>
        <li>What skills or qualities do you have to offer? </li>
        <li>When does a group work well and why? </li>
        <li>When does a group fail to work well and why? </li>
        <li>What do you think about boys and girls in the same group? </li>
      </ul>
      2. Ask each learner to complete a card like this one:
      <br />
      My name:
      ______________________________________________________________________________________
      <br />
      Three people I would like to work with on a project <br />
      1. _______________________________________________________________________________________________
      <br />
      2. _______________________________________________________________________________________________
      <br />
      3. _______________________________________________________________________________________________
      <br />
      Three people I would definitely NOT like to work with on a project:
      <br />
      1. _______________________________________________________________________________________________
      <br />
      2. _______________________________________________________________________________________________
      <br />
      3. _______________________________________________________________________________________________
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

      3. When you have all the information from the class, you can use it to
      make groups. If you like, make a table like the one below.
      <br />
      üòÄ means that a learner has a preference to work with this learner.
      <br />
      üôÅ means that a learner does not want to work with the other learner.
      <br />
      Here, Adri likes working with Bas, Christa and Ernst, but not with Beata,
      David or Jane. Aim to put the learners who like working together in the
      same group, but if this is not possible, spread the less popular learners
      between the groups.{' '}

      <strong>Information</strong>
      <br />
      We are all intelligent - in at least eight different ways. Which are your
      strong intelligences?An American professor, Howard Gardner, has discovered
      that we have at least eight different kinds of intelligences: linguistic,
      logical-mathematical, bodily-physical, visual-spatial, musical,
      naturalistic, interpersonal and intrapersonal. Here is a brief description
      of each intelligence. <br />
      <em>Linguistic:</em> Verbal. You like working with words, reading and writing.{' '}
      <br />
      <em>Logical-mathematical:</em> You like concepts, think logically and like
      puzzles and problems. <br />
      <em>Bodily-physical: </em>You enjoy sports and games. You like to move around
      and learn by doing. You use body language to communicate. <br />
      <em>Visual-spatial: </em>You think in images or pictures, learn by seeing
      and by using charts or diagrams.
      <br />
      <em>Musical: </em>You enjoy learning and/or making music. You have a sense
      of rhythm and melody.
      <br />
      <em>Naturalistic:</em> You enjoy the natural world, animals and are
      interested in the environment. <br />
      <em>Interpersonal:</em> Social. You like working in groups, and learn well
      if you study or discuss things with other people.
      <br />
      <em>Intrapersonal:</em> You understand your own feelings and thoughts. You
      like to daydream and fantasise and to work alone. You like to know why you
      are doing something.

      her scores. Fill in the right-hand pizza to show how your scores are

      tell you how they are doing as they go along. The aim of the questions is
      to get learners to think about their project and their role in the team.
