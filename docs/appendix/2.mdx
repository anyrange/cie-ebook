        the teacher. This gives them some time to think for themselves. Next, in
        pairs, learners compare and discuss their answers with each other.

        <br />
        <strong>Introduction to How SMS Works </strong>
        <br />
        ust when we‚Äôre finally used to seeing everybody constantly talking on
        their 1 ______ __________ it suddenly seems like no one is talking at
        all. Instead, they‚Äôre typing away on tiny numerical pads, using their 1
        ________________ to send quick messages. SMS, or 2 ________________, has
        replaced talking on the phone for a new ‚Äúthumb generation‚Äù of texters.
        <br />
        In this article, we‚Äôll find out how text messaging works, explore its
        uses and learn why it sometimes takes a while for your 2
        ________________ to get to its recipient.
        <br />
        SMS stands for 3 ________________. Simply put, it is a method of
        communication that sends text between 1 ________________, or from a PC
        or handheld to a cell phone. The ‚Äúshort‚Äù part refers to the maximum size
        of the text messages: 160 4 ________________ (letters, numbers or
        symbols in the Latin alphabet). For other alphabets, such as Chinese,
        the maximum SMS size is 70.
        <br />4 ________________.
        <br />
        But how do 5 ________________ messages actually get to your phone? [...]
        Even if you are not talking on your cell phone, your phone is constantly
        6 ________________ and 7 ________________.information. It is talking to its
        cell phone tower over a pathway called a 8 ________________. The reason for
        this chatter is so that the 9 ________________ system knows which cell your
        phone is in, and so that your phone can change 10 ________________ as you
        move around. Every so often, your phone and the tower will exchange.
        <br />a packet of data that lets both of them know that everything is
        OK.

        Even though we don‚Äôt see them, water molecules are in the air all around
        us; it‚Äôs called water
        <br />1 ____________________. When the molecules are 2
        ____________________ around in the atmosphere, they don‚Äôt normally stick
        together.
        <br />
        Squeezing the sides of the bottle forces the molecules to squeeze
        together or 3 _____ _______________. Releasing the pressure allows the
        air to 4 ____________________, and in doing so, the temperature of the
        air becomes cooler. This cooling process allows the molecules to stick
        together more easily forming tiny 5 ____________________ and clouds are
        nothing more than tiny water 5 ____________________. The smoke in the
        bottle also helps this process. Water particles will group together more
        easily if there are some solid particles in the air to act as a 6
        ____________________. The invisible particles serve as the 6 and help in
        the formation of the cloud. Clouds on Earth form when warm air rises and
        its pressure is reduced. The air 7 ____________________ and cools, and
        clouds form as the temperature drops below the 8 ____________________
        point. The invisible particles in the air may be in the form of
        pollution, smoke, dust or even tiny particles of dirt.

      <strong>Biology: blood vessels </strong>
      <br />
      This activity is useful for topics where sub-topics have three or four
      different characteristics. Use it at the end of a topic to revise what
      learners have learned.
      <br />
      1. Make a table containing your chosen topics and their characteristics.
      <br />
      2. Copy the table you have created onto different pieces of coloured
      cardboard, one colour for each group of learners. Cut out the cards and
      shuffle them.
      <br />
      3. Learners form groups of four. Each group is given a pile of shuffled
      cards (of a single colour). Tell them they have 10 minutes to arrange the
      cards into three logical columns on their table.
      <br />
      4. You circulate, asking critical questions and giving hints about the
      choices learners have made.
      <br />
      5. Learners should be encouraged to use English only and to explain to
      each other why they think a card belongs in a certain column.
      <br />
      6. After 10 minutes, the groups rotate. Each group moves to another table
      and has another 5 minutes to correct or reorganise the work of another
      group.
      <br />
      7. The groups return to their original table and try to discover the
      changes the other group made to their work. They reorganise the columns
      again, depending on whether they agree or disagree with the new order.
      <br />
      8. If learners get stuck, you can scaffold learning by providing a short
      text about the three topics. <br />
      9. Discuss the correct answers with the whole class or with individual groups.{' '}
      <br />
      10. The columns can be arranged to produce a table of properties (for
      example, of the three types of blood vessels) that can be copied into
      notebooks for revision.
      <br />
      <strong>Arteries: </strong>carry blood away from heart; blood at high
      pressure; no valves; thick muscular walls; no substances leave or enter
      vessel; pulse created by heart pumping & contraction of wall muscle;
      strong walls; carry oxygenated blood (with one exception)
      <br />
      <strong>Capillaries: </strong>carry blood through tissues and organs;
      blood at low pressure; no valves; very thin walls for escape of fluids;
      exchange of substances with tissues; no pulse; walls delicate and easily
      broken; carry mix of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood
      <br />
      <strong>Veins: </strong>carry blood towards heart; blood at lowest
      pressure; valves to stop blood flowing back; thinner walls with less
      muscle; no substances leave or enter vessel; no pulse; walls flexible &
      squashed easily so blood pushed further along vessel; carry deoxygenated
      blood (with one exception).

      stops, sugar

      It is possible to add a second step to this activity to emphasise the
      difference between academic and everyday language: ask learners to think
      of synonym pairs (quick - rapid; release - let go).
