## “Cornell Notes”

This  graphic  organiser  is used to take notes. Using this system, students break down their  copybook  into  three sections. It can be used while listening  to  or  watching  a video.  Students  record  the main idea, key questions on the left-hand column, while keywords, main details and ideas on the right-hand column. At the bottom, at the summary section students review topics.
