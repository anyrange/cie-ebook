## Inquiry-based learning

**From a student point-of-view**, inquiry-based learning focuses on investigating an open question or problem. They must use evidence-based reasoning and creative problem-solving to reach a conclusion, which they must defend or present.  
**From a teacher point-of-view**, inquiry-based teaching focuses on moving students beyond general curiosity into the realms of critical thinking and understanding. You must encourage students to ask questions and support them through the investigation process, understanding when to begin and how to structure an inquiry activity.

**The 4 Steps of Inquiry-Based Learning**  
So you discovered something that generates your own inquiry, and you’ve recreated that moment for your students when your curiosity was triggered. So what comes next in inquiry-based learning? This can be answered in four basic steps that should represent the outline of a simple unit.

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Students develop questions that they are hungry to answer</strong>.
    Have them develop a problem statement that requires them to pitch their
    question using a constructed response, further inquiry, and citation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Research the topic using time in class</strong>. It’s crucial to
    have some of this be classwork, so students have access to the head
    researcher in the room – you. You aren’t going to do the work for them, but
    you are going to guide them and model methods of researching reliably.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Have students present what they’ve learned</strong>. Students should
    create and present a culminating artifact. When I have my students present
    what they’ve learned, I use a rubric with “Able to Teach” as the acme of
    what to reach for. After all, many people can understand content, but can
    they communicate it? Students can develop a website using Weebly, or perhaps
    a slideshow using Google Slides.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Ask students to reflect on what worked about the process and what didn’t
    </strong>
    . Reflection is key. And it isn’t just about asking them to think back on
    their opinion of the topic. It’s about reflecting on the process itself.
    That’s where you can work in metacognition–thinking about thinking. Have
    students focus on how they learned in addition to what they learned.
  </li>
</ol>{' '}

In terms of your content area, imagine a classroom where different kids are presenting their findings on a single, simple aspect of the content. You’d have a classroom that, overall, learns deeper and wider than ever before.  
One easy way to dip your toes into the learning menu water is a Tic-Tac-Toe menu. A Tic-Tac-Toe can be used for anything from short activities to more long-term projects, both assessment FOR learning (formative) and assessment OF learning (summative).
In terms of student achievement, the power of their question should help drive the research, the writing, and the presentation. It should help motivate them to become experts in their self-described field. And the more often a student gets a taste of what it feels like to be an expert, in however small a concept, the more they will want that feeling later on in life.
