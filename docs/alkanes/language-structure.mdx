### CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIPS

<dl>
  <dt>
    <b>+ Advantage</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <em>e.g.</em> There are several <u>advantages of</u> catalytic cracking over
    thermal cracking.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <b>+ Benefit</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <em>e.g.</em> The <u>Obvious benefits of</u> catalytic cracking are abundant
    feedstocks, low cost, mild operating conditions and low energy consumption.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <b>+ Merit</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <em>e.g.</em> <u>Another merit of</u> catalytic cracking is that it produces
    a higher proportion of branched alkanes, which burn more easily than
    straight-chain alkanes and are, therefore, an important component of petrol.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <b>– Disadvantage</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <em>e.g.</em> However, there are <u>various disadvantages of</u> catalytic
    cracking.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <b>– Drawback</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <em>e.g.</em> High feed velocity is <u>one of the drawbacks of</u> catalytic
    cracking.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <b>– Downside</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <em>e.g.</em> <u>Another downside of</u> catalytic cracking is low depth of
    processing.VOCABULARY PRACTICE TIPS:DictoglossIt is a classroom dictation
    activity where learners are required to reconstruct a short text by
    listening and noting down key words, which are then used as a base for
    reconstruction. Worksheets with templates can be used while dictating
    sentences to students while they transcribe. First, have them write what
    they hear, then have them write what they see. They will get extra practice
    listening, reading and writing.7. Introduction to organic chemistry. Alkanes
