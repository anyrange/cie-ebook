## Glossary

<p>
  <strong>addition reaction</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/117.22a3c4db.mp3" /> - an organic reaction in which two
  reactant molecules combine to give a single product molecule.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>bitumen</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/118.51bcc907.mp3" /> – a fraction of crude oil consisting
  of hydrocarbon chains with 40+ carbon atoms. Also known as tar and used in road
  surfacing and in roofing.

<p>
  <strong>
    <em>cis–trans</em> isomerism
  </strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/119.fe269958.mp3" /> - a category of stereoisomerism in
  alkenes in which groups are attached to the carbon atoms involved in the double
  bond in a different way. In cis isomers, the groups are on the same side of the
  double bond, whereas in trans isomers, the groups are on opposite sides. Also known
  as geometric isomerism.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>catalytic cracking</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/120.3d56cf5b.mp3" /> – the bonds are broken using a high
  temperature (450<sup>o</sup>C, which is generally lower than in thermal cracking),
  a slight pressure (slightly greater than 1 atmosphere), and a zeolite catalyst.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>chain isomers</strong>
  <AudioButton url="/media/121.8aef396f.mp3" /> – a category of structural isomerism
  in which molecules have the same molecular formula but have a different arrangement
  of the carbon chain.
  <br />
  Chain isomers belong to the same homologous series. For example, 3-methylpentane
  and 2,3-dimethylbutane are both chain isomers of hexane.
