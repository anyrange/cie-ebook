    <strong>
      1. Using example, develop tasks for one of the following videos: your
      video worksheet should have THREE PHASES:
    </strong>
    <em> pre-watching, while-watching</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>
      post-watching
    </em> <strong>exercises.</strong>

### Learning objectives:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.4.2.1 recognise and understand the use of a variety of formula types
    </td>
    <td>11.4.2.4 understand and be able to use the IUPAC nomenclature</td>

#### 2. Develop one of the fragments of Lesson plan: you should use

- a lesson plan template [(**Appendix 1**)](../appendix/1);
- one of the CLIL techniques [(**Appendix 2**)](../appendix/2);
- teaching methods; and
- learning objectives above.
