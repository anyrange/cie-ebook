Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that can be used to deduce the molecular formula of an unknown compound. Gaseous molecules of the compound are bombarded with high-speed electrons from an electron gun. These knock out an electron from some of the molecules, creating molecular ions (M<sup>+</sup>), which travel to the detector plates.
The relative abundances of the detected ions form a mass spectrum: a kind of molecular fingerprint that can be identified by a computer using a spectral database. The peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) is formed by the heaviest ion that passes through the spectrometer. This value of m/z is equal to the relative molecular mass of the compound.  
High ‚Äì resolution mass spectrometry can be used to determine the molecular formula of a compound from the accurate mass of the molecular ion.  
A molecular ion is a positively charged ion, which is also a radical as it contains a single unpaired electron. It is therefore sometimes represented as M<sup>+</sup>‚Ä¢. During mass spectroscopy, the molecular ion can fragment into a positive ion and a radical.  
This fragmentation process gives rise to characteristic peaks on a mass spectrum that can give information about the structure of the molecule.  
Some uses of mass spectrometry include:

- Identifying elements in new or foreign substances, for example analysing samples from the Mars space probe.
- Monitoring levels of environmental pollution for example amounts of lead or pesticide in a sample.
- In biochemical research, for example, determining the composition of protein by comparing it against a database of known compounds.
