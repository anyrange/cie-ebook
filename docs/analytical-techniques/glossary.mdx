## Glossary

<p>
  <strong>adsorption</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/227.329d9250.mp3' /> - the adhesion of molecules to a surface. The molecules that attach are called adsorbate and the surface is the adsorbent. Adsorption is vital to chromatography.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>chemical shift</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/228.2733e98c.mp3' /> – a measure of the chemical environment of a particular nucleus within a molecule. Chemical shift values are quoted relative to a standard compound tetramethylsilane (TMS) and are measured in parts per million (ppm) of the strength of the magnetic field strength required for resonance in TMS.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>chromatogram</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/229.e664b601.mp3' /> - the visible record of the separation of substances in mixtures by chromatography.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>chromatography</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/230.55de2d8c.mp3' /> - a laboratory technique used to separate substances in a mixture. The mixture is dissolved in a mobile phase, which is then passed through a stationary phase. Substances are separated on the basis of their affinity with the stationary phase.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>column chromatography</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/231.809ccf38.mp3' /> – a form of chromatography in which the mixture to be separated is dissolved in a solvent. This is the eluent and is passed through a column containing a stationary phase (often aluminium oxide). The components of the mixture move at different rates through the column and can be collected as they run out of the bottom.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>eluent</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/232.7fbf2e99.mp3' /> – the mobile phase in column chromatography. Consists of the mixture to be separated dissolved in a solvent.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>fingerprint region</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/233.090621fd.mp3' /> – the region below 1500 cm-1 in an infrared spectrum, where there are many peaks which are difficult to assign. An exact match of the fingerprint region with a reference spectrum gives the identity of a compound.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>fragmentation</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/234.eddae219.mp3' /> – a phenomenon whereby some ions disintegrate into smaller fragments during mass spectrometry, leading to multiple peaks in the resulting spectrum.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>gas–liquid chromatography</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/235.7f866042.mp3' /> – a form of chromatography in which a mixture is injected into a coiled capillary tube inside an oven, where it vaporizes. An unreactive carrier gas (the mobile phase) transports the mixture through the coil, where the components interact with a powder lining the coil, which acts as the stationary phase. The components exit the coil at different times after injection and may pass straight into a mass spectrometer.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>high performance liquid chromatography</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/226.55f6f9c8' /> - a form of column chromatography in which the eluent moves through the column under high pressure. This results in a faster and more effective separation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>infrared spectroscopy</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/237.1ae40feb.mp3' /> – a technique that measures the absorption of different frequencies of infrared energy by a sample of a substance. This gives information about the types of functional group present in a compound.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>infrared spectrum</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/238.58de5e8b.mp3' /> – a plot of transmission of infrared radiation against wavenumber (1 / wavelength).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>integration</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/239.21e6fc38.mp3' /> – a mathematical technique for working out the area under the peak on a line graph. This is useful in proton NMR as the area under a peak in a 1H NMR spectrum is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms in that chemical environment. The integration trace 20911. Analytical techniques is sometimes shown as a line of the spectrum whose height is proportional to the number of hydrogen atoms of that type.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>mass spectrometry</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/240.543985cf.mp3' /> – an accurate instrumental technique that can be used to determine the relative isotopic mass and the relative abundance for each isotope of an element in a sample. This can be used to identify the sample.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>mass spectrum</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/241.b0fff586.mp3' /> – a plot of the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of detected fragments against their relative abundance.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>mass-to-charge ratio</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/242.17f8fd77.mp3' /> – the mass divided by the charge of an ion. Often called the m/z value.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>mobile phase</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/243.bae8a8db.mp3' /> – the part of chromatography consisting of the mixture to be separated dissolved in a solvent and passed over/through the stationary phase. The mobile phase can be a liquid or gas.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>molecular ion</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/244.0712f652.mp3' /> – the ion formed when a molecule loses an electron during mass spectrometry but does not fragment. Represented by the symbol M+
</p>
<p>
  <strong>molecular ion peak</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/245.fd801172.mp3' /> – the peak on the mass spectrum of a compound at the highest mass-to-charge ratio, which corresponds to the relative atomic mass of the molecular ion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>NMR spectroscopy</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/246.da1204b8.mp3' /> – a technique used to investigate the chemical environment of isotopes in a molecule which has an odd mass number (and so exhibit spin). NMR spectroscopy gives us information about the local environment of specific atoms in a molecule, and so can be used to deduce information about the molecular structure of a sample.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>NMR spectrum</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/247.3b402ef9.mp3' /> –  a plot of the different chemical shift values (in parts per million or ppm) of peaks found in NMR analysis of a compound. NMR spectra usually give information about the local chemical environments of 13C or 1H atoms in a molecule. The integration of the area under the peaks in a 1H NMR spectrum gives the relative number of protons in each type of chemical environment.<br/>Splitting of peaks in a 1H NMR spectrum gives information about the number of protons attached to adjacent carbon atoms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>retention time</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/248.a1af7347.mp3' /> - the time it takes for a component of a mixture to pass through the coil during gas–liquid chromatography.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>spin coupling</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/249.928a4969.mp3' /> - a phenomenon that occurs as the spins on atoms which are close together interact with each other.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>splitting</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/250.04e4582e.mp3' /> is the name given to the observation that peaks in 1H NMR spectra often appear as a number of clustered peaks rather than one single peak. This is due to spin coupling interactions between adjacent atoms, and therefore gives information about the number of nearby hydrogen atoms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>stationary phase</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/251.fc93cc0f.mp3' /> - the part of chromatography that remains stationary and separates the components of a mixture by interacting with them to different degrees. The stationary phase is usually a solid, often in powder form.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>thin layer chromatography (TLC)</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/252.505f7797.mp3' /> - a form of chromatography in which the stationary phase is a thin layer of adsorbent material attached to a plate of glass or plastic (TLC plate). A small drop of mixture is placed on the plate, which is placed vertically inside a jar containing solvent. This is the mobile phase and separates the components of the mixture as it rises up the TLC plate.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>TMS</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/253.582c19e0.mp3' /> - Tetramethylsilane. A substance used as a reference compound for NMR as its methyl groups are particularly well shielded and so it produces a strong, single peak at the far right of an NMR spectrum.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>wavenumber</strong>
  <AudioButton url='/media/254.7a812939.mp3' /> - the number of cycles of waves in a unit length; the reciprocal of wavelength (1 / wavelength). Usually measured in m<sup>-1</sup> or cm<sup>-1</sup>
