    <strong>
      1. Using example, develop tasks for one of the following videos: your
      video worksheet should have THREE PHASES:
    </strong>
    <em> pre-watching, while-watching</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>
      post-watching
    </em> <strong>exercises.</strong>

    </td>
    <td>
      11.1.4.43 understand that these techniques can yield information both by

#### 2. Develop one of the fragments of Lesson plan: you should use

- a lesson plan template [(**Appendix 1**)](../appendix/1);
- one of the CLIL techniques [(**Appendix 2**)](../appendix/2);
- teaching methods; and
- learning objectives above.
