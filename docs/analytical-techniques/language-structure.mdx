## BY VS. WITH (A METHOD OR A TOOL)

- Method of doing something expressed like this: <Highlight color="#1877F2">by + V<sub>ing</sub></Highlight>

<em>e.g.</em> By measuring the strength of the magnetic field that must be applied,
NMR spectroscopy gives us information about the local environment of specific atoms
in a molecule.
<br />
<em>e.g.</em> In biochemical research, for example, determining the composition
of protein <strong>by comparing</strong> it against a database of known
compounds.
<br />
<em>e.g.</em> Chromatography works <strong>by dividing</strong> the components of
a mixture between two phases – a stationary phase and a mobile phase.
<br />
<em>e.g.</em> Modern breathalyzers calculate the percentage of ethanol in the
breath <strong>by looking</strong> at the size of the absorption caused by the
C–H bond stretch in the alcohol.
<br />

- Instrument or tool for doing something expressed like this: <Highlight color="#1877F2">with + a noun phrase</Highlight>

_e.g._ The relative abundances of the detected ions form a mass spectrum: a kind of molecular fingerprint that can be identified by a computer **with a spectral database**.
