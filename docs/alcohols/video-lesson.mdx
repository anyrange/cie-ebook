## üíø ‚ÄúMaking Alcohols by Fermentation and from Ethene‚Äù

:::note
_This is an authentic video. Do not try to understand every word you hear._  
_Watch and listen for general and specific information by completing the following tasks._
:::

### Before you watch:

#### Exercise 1. Solve this riddle.

#### Exercise 3: Watch the video (1:07-1:30), PAUSE the video and answer the question asked by the speaker:

_Fermentation converts them into ethanol and carbon dioxide. You might notice this equation isn‚Äôt balanced yet so have a go as a mini challenge. PAUSE and continue when ready._

**Continue the video and check your answer (1:30)**

#### Exercise 4. Watch the video (1:31-2:01), PAUSE the video and answer the question asked by the speaker:

_Here‚Äôs the easy molecule and its molecular formula is the ethanol molecule from before. Now look at the numbers of each atom on both sides. Can you think of a very common molecule we can add to ethane to produce ethanol? Again, PAUSE and think then resume._

**Continue the video and check your answer (2:01-till the end).**

### After you watch:

#### Exercise 5. Solve the problem question.

What is the mass of ethanol that will be released during fermentation of 36 grams of glucose containing 25 % impurities?
