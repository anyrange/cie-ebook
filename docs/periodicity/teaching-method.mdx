## HOW do you lead students in the topic?

- **ODD ONE OUT.** Students are given a set of words with one word that does not fit. They need to find out why and guess the topic from the remaining words. **For example,** Beryllium – Gold – Magnesium – Calcium – Strontium – Barium. Gold is odd word, because the rest are the Alkaline Earth Elements. Thereby, students guess the topic.
- **What sounds can you hear?** Students sit in silence for a minute while listening to recording. They need to record into the copybook all the sounds they hear. Thereby, students can guess the topic of the lesson. **For example,** a sound of combustion or explosion can mean a reaction.
- **Name Ten:** students think and write ten items that fit particular criteria. For example,the topic is **periodicity:** metal, non-metal, atomic radius, first ionization energy, electronegativity ...
- **Word associations:**students are given an initial word, **for example**, a table. Each student takes it in turns to say a word which they associate with the previous word. If the connection isn’t obvious, challenge the student to justify their choice: a table – rows – horizontal lines – Periodic table – periodic elements ...
- **Mystery picture:** a teacher finds a picture that represents a topic of the lesson. To make the guess more difficult, a picture can be cropped into small pieces and shown separately one after another until students guess the topic.
- **Main idea and details:** students are given three details about the topic, and they need to guess the main idea from the detail clues.
- **Rebus.** The word that students will solve is a lesson topic.
- **Four pictures – one word.** Students are shown 4 images one by one, which are related to the topic, but not directly. Challenge students starting from the most difficult image, uncovering the most obvious one in the end.
- **Video.** Showing any topic-related video can be used to elicit topic from the students.
- **Unjumble / unscramble the word.** The word that students will solve is a lesson topic.
- **Showing an experiment** can also be used to introduce a lesson topic.
