#### HOW do you lead students in the topic?
<li><strong>ODD ONE OUT.</strong> Students are given a set of words with one word that does not fit. They need to find out why and guess the topic from the remaining words. <strong>For example,</strong> Beryllium – Gold – Magnesium – Calcium – Strontium – Barium. Gold is odd word, because the rest are the Alkaline Earth Elements. Thereby, students guess the topic.</li>
<li><strong>What  sounds  can  you  hear?</strong> Students sit in silence for a minute while listening to recording. They need to record into the copybook all the sounds they hear. Thereby, students can guess the topic of the lesson. <strong>For example,</strong> a sound of combustion or explosion can mean a reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Name Ten:</strong> students think and write ten items that fit particular criteria. For example,the topic is <strong>periodicity:</strong> metal, non-metal, atomic radius, first ionization energy, electronegativity ...</li>
<li><strong>Word associations:</strong>students are given an initial word, <strong>for example</strong>, a table. Each student takes it in turns to say a word which they associate with the previous word. If the connection isn’t obvious, challenge the student to justify their choice: a table – rows – horizontal lines – Periodic table – periodic elements ...</li>
<li><strong>Mystery  picture:</strong> a teacher finds a picture that represents a topic of the lesson. To make the guess more difficult, a picture can be cropped into small pieces and shown separately one after another until students guess the topic.</li>
<li><strong>Main idea and details:</strong> students are given three details about the topic, and they need to guess the main idea from the detail clues.</li>
<li><strong>Rebus.</strong> The word that students will solve is a lesson topic.</li>
<li><strong>Four pictures – one word.</strong> Students are shown 4 images one by one, which are related to the topic, but not directly. Challenge students starting from the most difficult image, uncovering the most obvious one in the end. </li>
<li><strong>Video.</strong> Showing any topic-related video can be used to elicit topic from the students.</li>
<li><strong>Unjumble / unscramble the word.</strong> The word that students will solve is a lesson topic.</li>
<li><strong>Showing an experiment</strong> can also be used to introduce a lesson topic.</li>
