<p>
  <b>amphoteric</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> - able to behave as both an acid
  and a base.
</p>
<p>
  <b>electronegativity</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – the ability of an atom to attract
  the bonding electrons in a covalent bond.
</p>
<p>
  <b>ionization energy</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> - the energy needed to remove 1
  mole of electrons from 1 mole of atoms of an element in the gaseous state to form
  1 mole of gaseous ions.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Periodic Table</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – the repeating patterns in the
  physical and chemical properties of the elements across the periods of the Periodic
  Table.
</p>
<p>
  <b>electron arrangement</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – a shorthand way of writing the
  number of electrons in an atom’s electron shells.
</p>
<p>
  <b>group</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – a column in the periodic table
  containing elements with the same number of outer shell electrons and similar chemical
  properties.
</p>
<p>
  <b>period</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – a row in the periodic table containing
  elements with the same number of full electron shells.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Property</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – Any characteristic of an element.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Trends down a group</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> - the number of outer shell electrons
  is the same; the number of complete electron shells increases by one.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Trends across a period</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> - the number of outer shell electrons
  increases by one; the number of complete electron shells stays the same.
</p>
<p>
  <b>acid</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – a substance that dissociates in
  water to produce hydrogen ions, or which donates protons and/or accepts electrons.
  Acids produce aqueous solutions with a pH less than 7.
</p>
<p>
  <b>alkali</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – a substance that dissociates in
  water to produce hydroxide ions, or which accepts protons and/or donates electrons.
  Alkalis form aqueous solutions having a pH greater than 7.
</p>
<p>
  <b>amphoteric</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – a substance that has the characteristics
  of an acid and an alkali and is capable of reactingсhemically either as an acid
  or an alkali. For example, aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is amphoteric:
  it reacts with acids to produce salts, and with alkalis to produce aluminates (substances
  containing the ion [Al(OH)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup>).
</p>
<p>
  <b>base</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – a compound that dissolves in water
  to produce an alkaline solution.
</p>
<p>
  <b>metal</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – an element, such as sodium and
  aluminium, formed from a regular lattice consisting of positivelycharged metal
  ions surrounded by a sea of delocalized electrons and held together by the attraction
  between them (metallic bonds). Metals are found on the left and middle of the periodic
  table.
</p>
<p>
  <b>metalloid</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – an element, such as silicon, that
  has properties (such as electrical conductivity) intermediate between metals and
  non-metals.
</p>
<p>
  <b>non-metal</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – an element, such as sulfur and
  chlorine, that typically has physical properties that are opposite to that of metals.
  For example, they typically have low melting and boiling points, solid non-metals
  are usually brittle, dull and act as electrical insulators. Chemically, nonmetal
  oxides tend to be acidic. Nonmetals are found on the right of the periodic table.
</p>
<p>
  <b>oxidation state</b>
  <AudioButton url={"/media/44.dc1b34e7.mp3"} /> – the charge a particular atom in
  a compound would have if the compound consisted entirely of separate ions. Also
  called the oxidation number. In ions, the oxidation state is the ionic charge.
  Elements are assumed to exist in the zerooxidation state.
