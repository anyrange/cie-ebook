## Assignments:

#### 1. Using example, prepare video tasks for the following video:

<dl>
  <dd>
    <li>
      <strong>Group 1 as an Example of Groups in the Periodic Table</strong>
    </li>
  </dd>
  Your video worksheet should have THREE PHASES:
  <dd>
    <li>
      <em>pre-watching,</em>
    </li>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <li>
      <em>while-watching</em> and
    </li>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <li>
      <em>post-watching</em> exercises.
    </li>
  </dd>
</dl>

## Learning objectives:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.2.1.1 recognise a number of forms of the Periodic Table, historic and
      modern.
    </td>
    <td>11.2.1.3 understand the significance of the s, p, d and f blocks.</td>
    <td>
      11.2.1.5 recognise periodicity in the table and be able to account for
      this in terms of effective nuclear charge, ionisation energy, bond types
      etc.
    </td>
    <td>
      11.2.1.7 recognise and be able to account for, in terms of effective
      nuclear charge, the following trends down groups: bond types, melting and
      boiling points, reactivity etc. (recognise and be able to account for
      trends down groups using (as a minimum) groups 1 and 17 as
      exemplification).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.2.1.2 be able to use the Aufbau Principle to explain the shape of the
      modern Periodic Table.
    </td>
    <td>
      11.2.1.4 be able to use the table to read and write the electronic
      configuration of any element.
    </td>
    <td colspan="2">
      11.2.1.6 recall and be able to explain general trends in melting and
      boiling points, atomic radius, first ionisation energy, acid/base
      properties (recall and explain general trends using the elements Na to Ar
      as exemplification).
    </td>
  </tr>
