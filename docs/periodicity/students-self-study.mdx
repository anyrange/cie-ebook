## Assignments:

#### 1. Using example, prepare video tasks for the following video:

    <strong>
      1. Using example, develop tasks for one of the following videos: your
      video worksheet should have THREE PHASES:
    </strong>
    <em> pre-watching, while-watching</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>
      post-watching
    </em> <strong>exercises.</strong>

        Group 1 as an Example of Groups in the Periodic Table
      </a>

## Learning objectives:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.2.1.1 recognise a number of forms of the Periodic Table, historic and
      modern.
    </td>
    <td>11.2.1.3 understand the significance of the s, p, d and f blocks.</td>
    <td>
      11.2.1.5 recognise periodicity in the table and be able to account for
      this in terms of effective nuclear charge, ionisation energy, bond types
      etc.
    </td>
    <td>
      11.2.1.7 recognise and be able to account for, in terms of effective
      nuclear charge, the following trends down groups: bond types, melting and
      boiling points, reactivity etc. (recognise and be able to account for
      trends down groups using (as a minimum) groups 1 and 17 as
      exemplification).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      11.2.1.2 be able to use the Aufbau Principle to explain the shape of the
      modern Periodic Table.
    </td>
    <td>
      11.2.1.4 be able to use the table to read and write the electronic
      configuration of any element.
    </td>
    <td colspan='2'>
      11.2.1.6 recall and be able to explain general trends in melting and
      boiling points, atomic radius, first ionisation energy, acid/base
      properties (recall and explain general trends using the elements Na to Ar
      as exemplification).
    </td>
  </tr>

#### 2. Develop one of the fragments of Lesson plan: you should use

- a lesson plan template [(**Appendix 1**)](appendix/appendix-1.mdx);
- one of the CLIL techniques (**Appendix 2**);
- teaching methods; and
- learning objectives above.
