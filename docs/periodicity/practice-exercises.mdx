#### 1. Complete these sentences about the periodicity. Use the words in the box:

<div style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "#fabcaa" }}>
  chemical properties, similar properties, atomic mass, valence electron,
  electron configurations, atomic mass, molar volume, atomic volume, electronic
  structure
</div>

<br />

The periodic table arranges the elements according to their
..................., in a such way that elements in the same column
have the same ................... configurations. Periodic variations in
size and................... are important factors in dictating the types
of chemical reactions the elements undergo and the kinds of
chemical compounds they form. The modern periodic table was
based on empirical correlations of properties such as...................;
early models using limited data noted the existence of triads and
octaves of elements with ..................... The periodic table achieved
its current form through the work of Dimitri Mendeleev and Julius
Lothar Meyer, who both focused on the relationship between
...................and chemical properties. Meyer arranged the elements
by their..................., which today is equivalent to the...................,
defined as molar mass divided by molar density. The correlation
with the................... of atoms was made when H. G. J. Moseley
showed that the periodic arrangement of the elements was
determined by atomic number, not atomic mass.

#### 2. Complete the tables about properties of period 3 elements using words: decreases, decreases, zero and others
